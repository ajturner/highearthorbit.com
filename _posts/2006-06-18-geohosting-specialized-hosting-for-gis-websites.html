<p><a href='http://nomad-labs.com/'>Nomad Labs</a> (<a href='http://geospatial.nomad-labs.com/'>geospatial blog</a>) started a new hosting service particularly targeting to geospatial websites. Their <a href='http://hosting.nomad-labs.com/' title='Nomad Labs GeoHosting'>GeoHosting</a> has installed and configured numerous GIS services and applications ready for developers to tie into for their spatial applications.</p>
<p>This is a great idea, and also an example of how a company can build a business around open-source technology. Nomad Labs has done all the work of installing, configuring, and maintaining the large, and often cryptic, set of services for a developer to just begin working on their specific application, rather than having to spend half of their time just being a system administrator.</p>
<p>The <a href='http://hosting.nomad-labs.com/' title='Nomad Labs GeoHosting'>GeoHosting</a> is limited to Australia only currently, but I could see this being expanded to other worldwide locations (especially since the premise of <a href='http://nomad-labs.com/'>Nomad Labs</a> is that they are spread all over the world).</p>
<p>The feature list looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>lighttpd + fastcgi</li>
<li>lighttpd + mapserver</li>
<li>mapscript</li>
<li>gdal/ogr</li>
<li>gdal bindings+</li>
<li>sftp data upload</li>
<li>postgis (requires higher-level hosting</li>
<li>5GB, 10GB, or 15GB data storage</li><br />
</ul></p>
