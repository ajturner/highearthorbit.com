  content: that driver was probably an idiot.... i think they should be able to drive.....being
    a 15 year old myself who drives VERY OFTEN. i bet you i would score higher on
    the drivers written and hands on test than you would, in fact i think you had
    to try 3 times to get your permit at 35 years old

  content: "im doing a debate on why i think 15 year olds should be able to.\r\nmost
    people keep rambling on about how 15 year olds arent marue enough well ya know
    what? everyone matures at there own age it could be 35, 7, 19, 42, 26, 14, 13,
    5 years old so dont say all that crap about matureness when you havent even looked
    it up yourself i think 15 is a good age i see no problem with it at all as long
    as they know what they need to know , and understand whats good to do and whats
    bad. waiting another 5 or 5 years is stupid all that time you could be driving
    and you people waste shame O_O :P"

  content: i think you guys are dumb as fuck, 15 year olds play video games do homework
    and ride bikes, some might even still play with their barbies. where does a 15
    year old need to go so bad that they need to drive.? to the store? let their parents
    do that, duhh...

While practice is good, especially with parents, this still seems young to be operating a large, heavily powered piece of machinery. The results of which are not always good. </p>
<p>This photo is one such result of a 15 year old driving with her father in Ann Arbor. She hit a curb, then the car and flipped the SUV. It's rather humours that the BMW SUV flipped so easily, with little apparent damage to the car it hit. </p>
<p>Especially humorous is that the gas-guzzling SUV ended up on the lawn of a Phud (Ph.D.) student of Natural Resources (read: hippy Environmental Engineer). </p>
