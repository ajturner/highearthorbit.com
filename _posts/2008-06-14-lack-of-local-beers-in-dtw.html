    rel=\"nofollow\">GRR Concessions page</a> there is hope. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nPS
    AIRPUB\r\nOffering cocktails and beer, including national brands and local favorites.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere
    is also a \"HOME TURF SPORTS GRILL\", that could offer some local brews. You'll
    have to investigate and let us know."

  content: I'm currently sitting in Newark, and hoped to find my favorite beer "Brooklyn
    Brown Ale" on tap, but alas, no local beer (unless you include the Miller Lite
    Brewery bar, which you of course don't)

<p><a href="http://www.draftmag.com/" title="DRAFT">Draft Magazine</a> has an article in this month's issue, "The Beer Drinker's Layover" that outlines the microbrew selection in restaurants at various airports around the US. Many of the airports feature local breweries and selections on tap, increasing the attraction and local feel of an airport to it's environs.</p>
<p>The sad part is at the top of their list of Airports to Avoid is <a href="http://www.metroairport.com/" title="MetroAirport.com">Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW)</a>. Michigan has a large, varied, and tasty <a href="http://www.michiganbrewersguild.org/findbeer.asp" title="Michigan Brewers Guild">selection of microbrews</a>. There are over 53 brewpubs and microbreweries in the state, and 18 in the immediate airport vicinity. It's a shame that no restaurants in the regional airport highlight this selection by offering it on tap. You can, however vist the "Guinness Pub", "Grey Goose Martini Bar", or "Jose Cuervo Tequileria". Not quite local selections.</p>
<p>While I don't live in Michigan anymore, I do tend to fly through DTW quite a bit and would definitely welcome being greeted with my local favorites. Something like an <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/arbor-huxell-best-bitter/9474/" title="Arbor Huxell Best Bitter from Arbor Brewing Company Pub &amp; Eatery">Huxell Best Bitter</a> from <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn org" href="http://arborbrewing.com">Arbor Brewing Company</a> in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">Ann Arbor</span></span></span> , <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/lilys-reggies-french-river-red-ale/13039/" title="Lilys Reggies French River Red Ale from Lilys Seafood Restaurant &amp; Brewery">French River Red Ale</a> from <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.lilysseafood.com/" title="Lily's Seafood Grill &amp; Brewery, Royal Oak, MI"><span class="org">Lily's Seafood</span></a> in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">Royal Oak</span></span></span> ,or the very unique and well named <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/founders-kentucky-breakfast-bourbon-aged-stout/40544/" title="Founders Kentucky Breakfast Bourbon Aged Stout from Founders Brewing Company, a Imperial Stout style beer: An unofficial page for Founders Kentucky Breakfast Bourbon Aged Stout from Founders Brewing Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan , United States of America">Kentucky Breakfast Bourbon Aged Stout</a> from <span class="vcard"><a class="url fn org" href="http://www.foundersbrewing.com">Founders Brewing Company</a> in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">Grand Rapids</span></span></span> .</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: the breweries above are marked up with <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" title="hcard - Microformats">hCards</a> - however, not aware if there is an hBeer (perhaps <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hproduct-proposal" title="hproduct-proposal - Microformats">hProduct</a>?) markup.</p>
<h3>The Magazine</h3></p>
<p>If you haven't seen it before, Draft is a bi-monthly magazine that covers the dramatically increasing micro- and local-beer scene and business. It's kind of the <a href="http://www.concierge.com/cntraveler/" title="Cond&Atilde;&copy; Nast Traveler Articles, Blogs, Videos, Lists, and Polls on Concierge.com">Conde Nast Traveler</a> for beer. What was most surprising was that I discovered at my family's house addressed to my younger sister. I'm quite envious indeed.</p>
