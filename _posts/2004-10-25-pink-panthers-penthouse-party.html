<p><img class='post' align='left' src='images/PinkPanther_PenthouseParty.jpg'><a href='http://www.pinkpanther.com/music/'>Pink Panther's Penthouse Party</a> is a pretty groovy little CD I picked up at a local record shop in Ferndale. I had heard it originally in their big "try me" bin, and they just had a used copy for sale.</p>
<p>Not too shabby for kinda groovin' & codin'. Gives you a little bit of the campy fifties with a more modern beat. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the shop didn't have any Plunge CD's, so I guess I'll just have to place an order. Plunge is a great fusion jazz kind of group with a trombonist lead, tuba player, and a drummer who is prone to play on his shaved scalp as often as not. </p>
