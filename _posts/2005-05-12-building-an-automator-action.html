<p>In the interest of working more with <a href='http://geobloggers.com'>GeoBloggers</a> and <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> - as well as my own interests in geolocation, I'm writing some <a href='http://apple.com/automator/'>Automator</a> actions. You gotta pay the toll to the bot. </p>
<p>I'm trying to create a photograph workflow that will archive images, apply EXIF copyright as well as geographic location, and then archive.</p>
<p>The tough part, obviously, is the geographic location. The rest was already all done by many small gnomes at 1 infinite loop. I've already written an <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/applescript/GeoExif.tgz'>GeoExif Applescript</a> that a user would select images in iPhoto, run this applescript, and then fill in the location information <em>piece by piece</em>. Tedious, no?</p>
<p>Anyways, building automator workflows is *incredibly* easy (well, except for sometimes getting the actions between other actions. sometimes the current actions just are little *too* friendly and all huggly and whatnot and then this "View Results" action's gotta be like 'hey, I wanna piece of this text'). </p>
<p>Just add the "Run Applescript" action to your workflow. A small, but illustrative example of what the applescript looks like for an automator action:</p>
<pre>
on run {input_items, parameters}<br />
	if input_items is not {} then<br />
		set myPrefix to "prefix_"<br />
		repeat with item in input_items<br />
			set (name of item) to myPrefix & (name of item)<br />
		end repeat<br />
	else<br />
	end if<br />
	return input_items<br />
end run<br />
</pre></p>
<p>To dissect: first we declare we want the <code>input_items</code> which are the magically river of data coming into and out of the connectors in automator actions. What <em>type</em> this input_items is automagically determined for you by the Applescript automator action. If you were writing your own action in XCode2 you would need to specify the acceptable types in your <code>InfoPList.strings</code> file. </p>
<p>So, first we see if this <code>input_items</code> has anything in it. If not (e.g. you didn't connect the input in Automator) then the array is empty and our <code>else</code> block gets run. If you *have* connected the input, then the array isn't empty and we start doing stuff with the input. </p>
<p>You may want to setup some stuff before the loop (such as setting a prefix variable), after which you just do <code>repeat with item in input_items</code> to begin recursing through all of the incoming objects. You can access the parameters of the object and whatnot to your heart's desire. </p>
<p>When you're done playing with the objects, just return them, or some semblence of your results, out to. This will get passed onto other actions.</p>
<p>Yay! you've written an automator action, yay!</p>
