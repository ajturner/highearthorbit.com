<p>So I *finally* have gotten my new T-Mobile account setup, after only, what, 15 days? Amazon's cell service is <b>horrid</b>. I can only recommend <a href='http://clicheideas.com/amazon.htm'>one course of action</a> for dealing with them. Actually, the alternative, that I took, was to bypass them and call T-Mobile directly. What took 15 days for amazon  (and counting) took T-Mobile all of 5 minutes! I hadn't hung up the phone with the customer service rep before I received my "Welcome to T-Mobile" message on my phone. I'm all a-tingle.</p>
<p>Anyways, so I've had the <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/gadgets/nokia6600.php'>phone</a> for about 4 days now, and I had just been fooling around with the setup on the device and my computer. Tried out the great, and infamous <a href='http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/'>Salling Clicker</a> on my <a href='http://apple.com/powermac'>G5</a>. Very nice control, though the old house I live in has pretty thick walls, so the distance connection isn't great.</p>
<p>However, the moment of "Woah" came when I placed my first call. As the call began my iTunes (specifically a little <a href='http://www.g-love.com/'>G. Love</a>) went silent, paused by my phone since I was making a call. As I said "woah".</p>
<p>One small problem so far, there seems to be a distinct background hiss on the Nokia 6600. I have to use it some more to determine if that's the case. A little annoying. But c'mon, what's sound quality on a phone when you have such cool <em>stuff</em>?</p>
