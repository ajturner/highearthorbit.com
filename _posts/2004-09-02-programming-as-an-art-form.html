<p>So I'm intensly curious about how programming and software can be expressed as an externally enjoyable art medium (audible, visual, tactile, etc) as well as mental. Even though I'm not an ActionScript programmer, I still like <a href="http://www.turdhead.com/index.php?p=21">The ActionScript Jabberwocky</a>.</p>
<p>And I'm not a Perl programmer (yet) but I may have to learn. There is an interesting article on writing software for music live at perl.com: <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/31/livecode.html">Hacking Perl in Nightclubs</a> by Alex Mclean. And also <a href="http://toplap.org/">TopLap.org</a> - <em>(Temporary|Transnational|Terrestrial) Organisation for the (Promotion|Proliferation|Permanence) of Live (Algorithm|Audio|Art|Artistic) Programming</em></p>
