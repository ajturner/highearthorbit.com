<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ajturner/3053738635/" title="North Island New Zealand from Starboard Side on Flickr - Photo Sharing!"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3246/3053738635_9b9d1ea63f_m.jpg" height="240" width="180" alt="North Island New Zealand from Starboard Side" name="3053738635_9b9d1ea63f_m.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; float: right;" /></a> With the lengthening days and the warming air, it is time again to begin the exciting whirlwinds of presentations, gatherings, rendezvous, and brainstorming.</p>
<p>This spring my conferences take me through nearly the entire gamut of possibilities in next generation mapping. This week I will be at the <a href="http://www.cgia.state.nc.us/ncgis2009" title="2009 North Carolina GIS Conference">North Carolina GIS Conference</a> in Raleigh talking about "Lessons Learned from Neogeography Applied to GIS." We are finally beginning some very poweful conversations between traditional Geographers, GIS experts, technologist and developers in determing how best to utilize our respective strengths to produce better applications, services, and data. My presentation will address some of the common criticisms of Neogeography that are being addressed and in the process offer insights into the effects these solutions will have on the future of GIS.</p>
<h3>Geo for non-geo's</h3></p>
<p>Two weeks later I'm speaking at <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org" title="March 4-7 2009 | DrupalCon DC">DrupalCon</a> with <a href="http://jeff.miccolis.net/" title="jeff.miccolis.net" rel="met">Jeff Miccolis</a>, locally here in DC, on <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/drupal-and-geospatial-web" title="Drupal and the Geospatial Web | DrupalCon DC">Drupal and the Geospatial Web</a>. We will be discussing the specifics of geospatial data and services and Drupal modules and practices that are able to leverage these capabilities in CMS's and portals.</p>
<p>The following week, March 13-17, I'm particularly excited about as I'm moderating a panel at <a href="http://sxsw.com/" title="Welcome to South by Southwest 2009 | SXSW.com">SxSW Interactive</a> titled "Neocartography: Web Usability and Design Evolved". Designers, usability and interaction experts are utilizing more geospatial data and visualization in web applications and it's important to consider the options, impacts, and potential future paths that they can help discover. More on this later.</p>
<h3>Back into the lion's den</h3></p>
<p>A week after SxSW I am heading to Las Vegas for the American Association of Geographer's Meeting. Last year <a href="http://twitter.com/kindaspatial/statuses/789894554" title="Twitter / Jesse Rouse: Our Participatory Geoweb s ...">Jesse Rouse shared</a> that myself and my work was a particular topic of interest in the participatory GeoWeb session at the AAG meeting in Boston. So I'm very interested to partake in a couple of panels on neogeography and open-source geospatial software. In addition, I'll be <a href="http://communicate.aag.org/eseries/aag_org/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=26157" title="AAG - 2009 Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, NV">presenting at paper</a> on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> and collaborative, participatory mapping.</p>
<h3>And now for something completely different</h3></p>
<p>A bit of a breather through April, where I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com" title="JSCONF 2009">JSConf</a> here in DC on something not geospatial. JavaScript for vehicle simulation and immersive worlds, based on my work at Realtime Technologies working on <a href="http://simcreator.com/" title="Realtime Technologies, Inc. SimCreator">SimCreator</a>. There is a bevy of brilliant JavaScript innovators and leaders that are finally getting a chance to gather around what has become the most ubiquitous, but under-discussed, programming language.</p>
<p>In between those conferences there is also the triumverate of TransparencyCamp, Government2.0 Camp, and eDemocracy - obviously a very hot topic in the geospatial and broader technology worlds. It's intriguing that there are 3 separate camps, all run by different groups with varying agendas and a chance to be the leaders in gathering people. Even *camps can have politicking.</p>
<p>I'm excited about all these chances to brainstorm with very brilliant people from a variety of domains. From GIS, to designers and open-source developers, Geographers, and goverati. Between the varied concepts, principles, and needs we can distill commonalities and collaborations. So please, check out my <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/ajturner" title="DOPPLR: Andrew Turner" rel="me">Dopplr profile</a> and let me know if we can meet up at any of these conferences!</p>
