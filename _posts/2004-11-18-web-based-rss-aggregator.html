<p>So I just installed <a href='http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/'>Feed on Feeds</a>, which is a web-based RSS aggregator. I am frequently moving between computers, both at my house, and while traveling, etc. Therefore, having a single, web-based aggregator is a pretty nice deal. At least, a good solution for the moment.</p>
<p>This is very similar to <a href='http://feedster.net'>Feedster</a>, except that I can put it on my own server, and also not be a-feared as to what some ad-tracker thinks of my viewing habits and attempts to put me in a box (or small cage with bars). </p>
<p>A better solution would be able to sync together all my subscriptions, bookmarks, where I've read, etc. with my various aggregators. </p>
<p>Too much information, my brain huuuurts....</p>
