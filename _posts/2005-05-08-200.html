    have such a to-do list for that project, it's incredible. :)  There are a few
    things I might be able to do to at least mitigate these issues, but it will take
    a bit more development."

  content: 'There are other similar systems like Intel''s PlaceLab, Navizon, and Skyhook.
    These require a db of AP for proxmity or triangulation purposes.  Some systems
    like Navizon, depend on volunteer-based "war-driving" where users contribute Wi-Fi
    APs (coverage area and AP''s xy locations) collected automatically by the Navizon
    software. '

<p><a href='http://www.herecast.com/'>HereCast</a> is "an open infrastructure for location-based services using Wifi". I.e. it allows users to determine their geographic location based on the wireless access points (AP) there computer can see. This is similar to what I proposed in my <a href='http://linuxjournal.com/article/7856/'>Linux Journal article on Geolocation</a>. </p>
<p>However, this system does appear to require a user-built database of AP MAC addresses -> location. It is nice in that the system displays the canonical name for the location, rather than just a confusing latitude/longitude. However, such user-built systems require such a long-term investment of *potential users* before anyone can be an *actual user* they almost never work. The activation energy is too high to start the reaction.</p>
<p>Now, it people started embedding location information *inside* the AP, then the system could spread independent of a central server. It still requires activation energy, but does not require a single-point of information entry/retrieval like many of these other systems do. </p>
<p>If databases are still necessary, it would be better to develop a system where any number of "database servers" could gather information for a region (or just friends, a team, company, etc), and then publish this information via an RSS feed or some other mechanism that any user could then slowly gather and use as necessary. </p>
<p>"Oh, I'm heading to New York, let me grab a link to the NY-AP-LD (New York Access Point Location Database) and I can track my progress & look up useful info!</p>
