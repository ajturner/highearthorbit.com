  content: "Great plug-in.  Well done.\r\n\r\nIs there more documentatio somewhere?\r\n\r\nFor
    example: \r\nIs there an option to pick type of google map (Satelitte, hybrid,
    map) and zoom level - my map keeps using a different zoom than the one I selected
    in the \"write\" area. .  Sorry can't seem to see it. \r\n\r\nYou mention the
    ability to upload GPX file.  Is there more info somewhere on how exactly to do
    this?\r\n\r\nRegards"

  content: "Good to meet you in Brussels last weekend - well done for getting it out
    of the door in time, and thanks for using Mapstraction!\r\n\r\nOne thing I thought
    would be good for a blogging plugin, that I've mentioned to Mikel before, would
    be to make an interface on a static image API (Yahoo has one) for red-dot maps.
    \ That way an image would show up in aggregators and without javascript, and could
    be swapped out for an interactive map if needed (or only on the post page, perhaps,
    instead of having 10 Google maps on the front page).  Of course, the interactive
    maps are often overkill anyway, so this would have potential usability benefits.\r\n\r\nI'll
    be taking a closer look at GeoPress soon, and hopefully I can contribute.\r\n"

    into WordPress, it is zoomed out too far and then shows nothing if I use the INSERT_MAP.

  content: "Thanks for all the feedback. These are really great suggestions.\r\n\r\n@steve
    - good question. Right now the macros don't allow selecting street/sat/zoom
    - this is being added\r\n\r\n@tom - GeoPress actually currently gets the YahooMap
    image url - but doesn't replace it for RSS, this is on the list to be added\r\n\r\n@greg
    - The problem is that the GeoPress map is defaulting to Satellite imagery, and
    there may not be any for Bamako, Mali at that Zoom level. Have you tried Yahoo
    or Microsoft Map? Also, as steve suggested, I need to add the ability to set Zoom
    and MapType in the INSERT_MAP.\r\n\r\nActually, one suggestion was to setup the
    map in the 'Post' screen like you want it to look like (sat/street/hybrid,
    zoom level, center point) and then store those settings as the settings to use
    in the posted map."

    But Yahoo doesn't know about as many places as Google. For example, Diafarab&Atilde;&copy;.
    \r\n\r\nAs for the suggestion to save the settings in the post, I don't understand
    that.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure coordinates are working for me either, but I'll test
    them in the US to see if they work, it just may be the low res Africa problem.\r\n\r\nI'm
    definitely over my head here. I'm interested because I'll be in West Africa for
    a couple of months starting in November."

    easy for non-Geo experts to easily add locations. So you're the target user. :)\r\n\r\nDiafarab&Atilde;&copy;,
    Mali works when I try it out. One problem is that the Zoom level is too high at
    default. So you need to zoom out to see it. \r\n\r\nI will be releasing an update
    tomorrow (Sunday, Sept 23) that should address these issues to make it a little
    easier for you. If you have any questions - feel free to email me (check the About

  content: "Killer job on this - I used the original Geopress plugin by Ravi and it
    was clunky and difficult to get working.  With yours I unzipped it and using a
    few of your helpful functions like the_address(), I had it integrated into my
    travelogue in no time.  Which is great, because I'm leaving for a 7-month RTW
    trip in about 36 hours. :) \r\n\r\nI did a few nice things like checked to see
    if the location exists before printing out \"from ...\" on my archive pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ghidinelli.com/go/trips/round-the-world/\r\n\r\nIs
    there a way to get the friendly display name as opposed to the full address for
    the geo location?  It would be nice to show \"Home\" or \"Auckland\" as opposed
    to my full home address or the hotel where we stayed or a zip code? "

<a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/09/geopress_adds_maps_to_wordpres.html' title="O'Reilly Radar: GeoPress adds maps to wordpress">O'Reilly Radar</a> was the first to announce the <em>release</em> of <a href="http://www.georss.org/geopress" title="GeoPress homepage">GeoPress</a>, a WordPress blog engine plugin that allows you to easily add location to blog posts, embed dynamic maps, and add <a href="http://georss.org" title="GeoRSS homepage">GeoRSS</a> encoding to your RSS output. </p>
<p>There have been other geo plugins before. However, they usually required you to make your own modifications to your template and provided a fairly arcane interface. The goal of GeoPress was to make adding location as simple as possible. Once you install GeoPress (copy and unzip to a <code>wp-content/plugins/geopress</code> directory on your WordPress site), and activate it (on the plugins panel), your configuration is done. Then go to write a blog post and you'll see a new area with a map and boxes underneath the post.</p>
<p>You can enter an address, or a city, or just a country, or even click on the map to set the location. You can then add a name which will be saved and can later be used for quick reuse. If you want to insert a map into your post, just type INSERT_.MAP somewhere in your post. You can also use INSERT_.ADDRESS and INSERT_.COORDS, which will insert the address and coordinates, in appropriate adr and geo Microformats. Since GeoPress uses <a href="http://mapstraction.com" title="Mapstraction">Mapstraction</a>, you can switch between displaying Yahoo, Google, or Microsoft maps with just a quick select in your settings. </p>
<p>There are also some PHP functions for modifying your template to embed maps or post locations. Using <code>geopress_map()</code> you can embed a map of all your locations. <code>the_address()</code> can be used in your post metadata to always automatically output something like "this post was written by Bob from Waikiki, Hawaii". </p>
<p>Lastly, the part that will be most useful in the future, is that the locations your write about will be embedded as GeoRSS in your RSS feeds. Aggregators like <a href="http://mapufacture.com" title="Mapufacture">Mapufacture</a> or <a href="http://fofredux.sf.net" title="FoFRedux">FoFRedux</a> will now be able to aggregate your geographic data and allow others to easily find interesting places, and build mashups. </p>
<p>Please let me know what you think!</p>
