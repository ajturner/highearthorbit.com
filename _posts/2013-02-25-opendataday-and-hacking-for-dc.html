<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/8506078106/" title="World Bank Globe by Andrew Turner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8506078106_d4007638c9_n.jpg" width="320" height="213" style="float:right;padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:5px;padding-left:5px" alt="World Bank Globe" /></a>I often say that Washington, DC is a city that thinks more about the world than it does about itself. Situated as the Nation's capital, headquarters to a multitude of multinational organizations, and even home to people from all over the world, DC works at large scales that cover other cities, regions, and countries. Even the governance of DC itself is subject to the politics and power of unelected officials.</p>
<p>So it is a bit ironic that the international <a href="http://opendataday.org/" title="International Open Data Hackathon">OpenDataDay Hackathon</a>, hosted locally at the World Bank brought together so many smart and technically talented people to work on local DC datasets and solutions.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8500623959_2ffc953865.jpg" alt="8500623959_2ffc953865.jpg" style="float:right;padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:5px;padding-left:5px;width:300px" />You can see the summary and links to all of the various projects on the <a href="http://dc.opendataday.org" title="OpenDataDay DC">OpenDataDay DC hackpad</a>. There is a wealth of interesting links, problems, ideas, and output; from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gwirth/sets/72157632841459992/with/8501771862/" title="OpenDataDay-TreeMappingDC - a set on Flickr">mapping the locations of trees by species</a>, to analysis of DC public school vs. charter school performance and walkability.</p>
<p>Beyond just this one day event there is a burdgeoning community of people that are data astute and gathering together to perform some really great projects. DataKind is hosting a follow up <a href="http://datakindworldbank.eventbrite.com/" title="DataKind DC DataDive with the World Bank - Eventbrite">DC DataDive</a> on March 15-17, 2013. <a href="http://datacommunitydc.org/" title="Data Community DC - supporting the analytics community with events and more">Data Community DC</a> is an umbrella of at least four other meetup groups discussing data visualization, data science, data business and the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" title="The R Project for Statistical Computing">R analysis platform</a>.</p>
<p>And if you want to focus on DC, then the new <a href="http://codefordc.org/" title="Code for DC | Hello, DC!">Code for DC</a> chapter of the Code for America Brigade has a few focused projects looking at social services, neighborhood councils, education, and even fire hydrants. Sometimes it's necessary for us to spend our time and volunteer efforts locally in the communities where we live.</p>
