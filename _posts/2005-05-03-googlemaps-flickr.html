    Flickr integration. BTW you can embedd a Panoramio map in your site, <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/blog/?p=16"

  content: "Well done mash-up. I especially like some of the small touches: highlight
    the map icon on hover of the photo, zoom in/out using the mouse-wheel, and
    the photo w/ map next to it.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work."

<p>This title seems like I've written it before. I know for sure it's an idea I've been playing with for awhile, but I get distracted with other geo-projects *so* easily. :)</p>
<p><a href='http://www.geobloggers.com/'>GeoBloggers</a> searches the Flickr site for 'geocoded' images with GPS position in the Exif data or <code>geo:lat=53.013, geo:lon=-2.175, geotagged</code> tags in the Flickr tags. It then displays these on a stand-alone version of the GoogleMaps.</p>
<p>Very slick, very simple, very effective. </p>
