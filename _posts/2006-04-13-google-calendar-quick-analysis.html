<p>So Google has released their much assumed <a href='http://www.google.com/calendar/'>Calendar</a>. Here is a quick analysis after using it for about 10 minutes (I will play with it more later):</p>
<ol>
<li>Feels pretty solid & responsive. GMail has sometimes felt laggy to me, but so far calendar seems to snap and respond well</li>
<li>Quick and easy adding/viewing/editing of events using the Google Map style popup bubbles</li>
<li>If you put in the "where" of your location, you can then map to it using GoogleMaps</li>
<li>Similar color scheme to GMail, so I'm already used to the pastels and they feel... <em>comforting</em></li>
<li>Public sharing of calendars, and invitation to events is very nice - but everyone has to be using GMail. <strike>What happened to the iCal invites that both Act! and Outlook and I assume others, support?</strike> - Gmail will detect events in email (similar to their 'Map this' detection)</li>
<li>Speaking of interplay, <strike>no import/export of calendar information.</strike> Most people already have <em>some</em> calendar going that they may like to bring their current events in from (like importing an address book in GMail). <strike>It doesn't appear that this is available yet, limiting my move to Google Calendar exclusively</strike> - this is available under settings and then another tab</li>
<li><strike>No RSS or other feed of my events - so I have to keep coming back to Google Calendar</strike> - I just can't figure out how to find a specific feed to one of my calendars, more digging</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Good start - though I'd like a little more open-ness of the data via import/export, RSS, and perhaps a nice little API. Also, interplaying with other calendaring programs (especially desktop ones) is very important. <strike>Like syncronizing with my Apple iCal.</strike></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  bad me, many of the import/export/RSS features are there, I suggest one takes the 'tour' (or RTFM) to see the features and where they're hidden.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> oh, and it <a href='http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/04/13/google-calendar-is-out-not-for-nokia-770-though/'>doesn't work on the Nokia 770</a>.
