<p>Like most any other person, I find ultimate joy in reliving happy experiences of my childhood. Frequently, this is only made by traversing <a href=''>memory lane</a>. That, or a heavy dose of <a href='http://ebay.com'>eBay</a> searching for that old <a href='http://www.99er.net/ti.shtml'>TI 99/4a</a> to play some <a href='http://www.videogamehouse.net/parsec.html'>Parsec</a>.</p>
<p>Well, thankfully, there are large hordes of people spending all of their free time remaking these memories to run on modern machines. Case in point, <a href='http://priv.solsector.net/'>Wing Commander: Privateer</a>. Now I can fly about the galaxy, selling my goods and killing nasty pirates on <a href='gadgets/'>my Mac</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is a <a href='http://www.parsec.org/'>remake of Parsec</a>. Excellent...</p>
<p>Also check out <a href='http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/'>Vegastrike</a>, which is a "3D Space Simulator that allows you to trade and bounty hunt in a vast universe. Can you face the dangers and decisions that await..."</p>
