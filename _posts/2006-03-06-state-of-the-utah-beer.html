<p>Spent the weekend boarding and skiing at <a href='http://www.snowbasin.com/'>several</a> <a href='http://www.thecanyons.com/'>excellent</a> Utah <a href='http://www.skibrighton.com'>facilities</a>. Doing a little touring, trying out new slopes. It's all such a new world to me, after growing up on the east coast ski scene.</p>
<p>Of course, while in <a href='http://www.lds.org/'>bountiful country</a>, I was keen on trying out some local brews. One of my original exposures to "odd beers" was a trip long-ago with several other crazy <a href='http://www.sssl.aoe.vt.edu'>graduate students</a>. One such student (hi <a href='http://doubledot.net'>Jana</a>) shared a 10-beer sampler with me, whereupon we went down the line, from Hefeweizen to Stout by way of Pale Ale and Red. It was pretty consistent that Jana preferred the darker beers, and I (a relative beer-newb) preferred the lighter ones. Of course, at that time I tended to gravitate towards Apple Ciders as my drink of choice, so my opinions were obviously very "colored" and that of a young beer-padawan.</p>
<p>I have since graduated myself to at the very least a Beer-Knight, and in hopes of one day becoming a Beer-Meister (note the spelling). But I am not there yet, the road is long, and when you're having so much good brew, it's easy to lose your way.</p>
<p>Now, back to the "State of the Utah beer". Utah, being bountiful country (as I mentioned) tends towards mandates on allowable alcoholic contents of beers (capping it at 3.2%), this does not prevent flavor and variety of the beers. </p>
<p><a href='http://www.roostersbrewingco.com/layton/main.html'>Roosters</a> (<a href='http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&hs=lNT&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=roosters&near=Layton,+UT&sa=X&oi=locald&radius=0.0&latlng=41060278,-111970278,11983534621709839784'>GoogleMap</a>) was the target of choice this past Saturday. It is a new restaurant, located in the town of Layton. I got the "Polygamy Pale Ale", the chocolate stout, the Amber Ale, and the Hefeweizen.</p>
<p>Interestingly, their Hefeweizen is the most popular due to the fact that it is their "lightest" (both in feel and ABV). The Polygamy Pale Ale had a very hoppy head and taste, but then an rather unlikeable metal aftertaste. I couldn't recommend it until they fix the aftertaste. The Rooster's Chocolate Stout was an excellent dessert drink, but a little much after a huge meal of hummus & pita, and very yummy capellini.</p>
<p>Just a short review of a suprise find where we were skiing - thought I'd let any other travelers know to take heart in Utah and sample some good, western brews. </p>
