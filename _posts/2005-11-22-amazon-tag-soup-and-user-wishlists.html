  content: Yeah I'm not sure if I like the Amazon tags yet. They need to make it a
    little more personal then I think it will work well.

<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-AmazonTags.JPG' alt='Amazon Tags' align="right" hspace="10px"/>While doing a little Christmas and <a href='http://dealnews.com'>deal</a> perusing, somehow in my "webpage-peripheral" vision I noticed a change to the Amazon layout. They are now sporting, of all things, <strong>tags</strong>. Supposedly the idea being you can tag items by people you are shopping for. Perhaps, ala <a href='http://del.icio.us'>del.icio.us</a> you could tag <var>tobuy</var> or <var>toshoparoundfor</var>. </p>
<p>After you fill in a tag, you can then view all of your tags, or other users who also used the same tag. What's particularly hilarious, is I could tag something "Sue", perhaps for my great aunt Sue (no, I don't have an Aunt Sue, work with me here). I can then go and view everything else <em>other people</em> have wanted to buy for <em>their</em> "Sue". </p>
<p>What's also eerie, something I found out while writing this post, is that you can view <em>who</em> first used the tag. Which lead me to a new area of Amazon.com (to me at least) which allows you to view and search by people. I can then go and search by all the "Bob Katz" of the world and see their wishlists, hometowns, profiles, etc. </p>
<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-BlenderMap.JPG' alt='Blender Map' align="left" hspace="10px"/>Rev Dan Cat (of <a href='http://geobloggers.com/'>) </a><a href='http://geobloggers.blogspot.com/2005/11/amazon-tags.html'>put out a great idea</a> - geotagging Amazon items. However, <em>what</em>, for example, is a geolocated blender? Perhaps where the item is coming from, manufactured, or best used? I could see trying to "buy local". Maybe user comments could be geolocated, as I may tend to agree more with people's opinions from the great island nation of <a href='http://www.tuvaluislands.com/' target='_new'>Tuvalu</a> then someone from <a href='http://www.wisconsinhistory.org'>Wisconsin</a>. </p>
