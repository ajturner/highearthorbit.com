<p>... or, "Why it's odd when people do for free what you do for a job."</p>
<p>I just read about <a href='http://realvirtualcar.blogspot.com/'>Real Virtual Car</a>, a group of guys took a wrecked (correct spelling, unlike the original <a href='http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/05/real_virtual_ca_1.html'>Make</a> posting) car and turned it into a driving simulator.  They're using NASCAR racer, the <a href='http://www.phidgets.com/'>Phidget</a> interfaces, and some racing wheels. Very nice job.</p>
<p>However, <a href='http://simcreator.com/'>we</a> do the same thing, except probably for a *little* more money. :) </p>
<p>It's amazing how much video games fudge reality to make a game more 'fun' than 'real'. Of course, I myself wouldn't necessarily plop down $60 on a game to replay reality. Dammit, I want cool jumps, fast take off, and flipping collisions!</p>
<p>They also included a link to a free racing simulator, <a href='http://www.racer.nl/ '>Racer</a>. I'll have to compile this up and see how it runs. </p>
