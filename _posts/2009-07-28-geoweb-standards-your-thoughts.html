  content: GeoRSS, KML, and GeoJSON are the itching powder, squirting ink pen, and
    dribble cup of geodata formats. The only worse ones are all the others that have
    no hypertext capability at all (with apologies to <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html"
    rel="nofollow">Clay Shirky</a>).

  content: "Thanks Sean - excellent quote :) \r\n\r\nI agree that these formats each
    have issues, yet are the most closely aligned with the Web, rather than a file
    just served off the web. \r\n\r\nOne particularly, potentially interesting format
    that's being overlooked is OpenStreetMap. I'm impressed with the linkedgeodata.org
    and the 3 Billion triples. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we still have a ways to go both
    in providing useful, usable, expressive formats, and moving tools and data providers
    to using these formats."

  content: "So, Sean loves GML? XML schema has anyURI as a primitive property type
    after all ;)\r\n\r\nGML has certainly its use, but it is not always the right
    tool (exchange format) for the right job.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely a ways to
    go, but the problem is that it is often not clear what would work well upfront,
    and even if you find something that works well in one case, it doesn't work well
    in another case (if at all).\r\n\r\nAt least I don't think the goal is to have
    one unifying format, but we'll end up with multiple (smaller) formats instead,
    each which should do their specific job well. The internet and the Geoweb are
    no monoliths, so neither are the standards which drive them."

  content: "I agree with ajturner on the .osm format - it is a breeze to code scripts
    for that format. And I do think that if you give JOSM a couple of years, you'll
    get something that will be quite capable of standing against traditional desktop
    GIS software.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, GML is too loosely defined to easily develop
    tools that work with *all* kinds of GML. And I get headaches every time I have
    to read an OGC standard to implement it. Any geo-standard that is longer than
    5 pages deserves being thrown into the garbage bin."

  content: "@IvanSanchez: It is definitely tough to develop a generic GML reader.
    The next file you try gives new problems. However, at least in all those pages
    of the GML spec, the authors try to add some order to the nearly endless flexibility
    of XML schema (which can be abused in many ways). Also additions like the Simple
    Features profile help, but even then it is difficult.\r\n\r\nIf you would ask
    me honest and personally, I think GML will still live on for a long time, but
    it will be mostly used for specific formats / application schemas, like CityGML,
    OS MasterMap, etc. It will never take the role shapefiles (still) have right now,
    because everyone will let his GML writer output a slightly different flavor, and
    dealing with all those cases is a too high barrier for most people (cost and time)."

  content: "From my perspective - GML is like programming in XML. The documentation
    reinforces that too as it's primarily about classes, inheritance, including namespaces,
    etc. So writing a parser/reader is like writing a scripting interpreter. \r\n\r\nSo
    @Frank - I agree with your ending sentiment. There won't be \"one format to rule
    them all\", but instead what's working is linking between formats. Consumers can
    choose if they want the HTML version for a human browser, or the KML for 3D browsing,
    or the GML/Shapefile/Spatialite for some GIS analysis.\r\n\r\nthanks for
    the thoughts, and keep them coming! I'll make sure and share the outcome presentation
    and feedback from GeoWeb."

  content: "KML is fine, but fairly limited in what it can convey... still wishing
    that X3D had been better up to this task (I come from an OpenInventor background).
    \ GeoRSS drove me a bit crazy when trying to build some feeds for Google... the
    GeoRSS.org schema is not properly setup.\r\n\r\nFrustrations documented in a couple
    days of posts ending with:\r\n\r\nhttp://schwehr.org/blog/archives/2009-07.html#e2009-07-28T14_12_02.txt\r\n\r\nSo
    I've got feeds, but even though they validate, I don't think they are right.\r\n\r\nNow
    if I want to share properly documented topo or bathy, I have to dive into the
    world of Collada, BAGs (bathymetry attributed grids), opendap, etc or get lost
    in the land of proprietary file formats.  For some of us how the data was processed
    and what the uncertainty values are is almost as important as the actually data."

<p>Later this week I'm speaking at GeoWeb about the current progress of GeoWeb standards, how far we have to go, and how to get there. We have KML and GeoRSS leading the way in searchable, linkable formats, but still a plethora of Shapefiles strewn about. There are questions of findability, semantic ontologies, durability, and expressiveness. What are the adoption rate of these formats and their utility in the future real-time, mobile, linked, open web?</p>
<p>What else do you think is the good and bad of GeoWeb standards?</p>
