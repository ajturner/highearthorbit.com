<p><a href='http://aol.com' title='AOL Homepage'>AOL</a> has decided to make a try for the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0' title='Wikipedia: Web2.0'>Web2.0</a> phenomenon by fulfilling a rule of <a href='http://www.squidoo.com/introtoweb20/' title='Squidoo: Intro to Web2.0'>Web2.0</a>, releasing a public API. </p>
<p><a href='http://developer.aol.com/' title='AOL Developer Homepage'>AOL Developer</a> introduces a set of API's meant to tie into existing AOL services like instant messaging (<a href='http://developer.aim.com/' title='AIM Developer Homepage'>AIM</a>), AOL Music, WinAMP player, homepages, and <a href='http://openapi.info/' title='MapQuest OpenAPI blog'>MapQuest's OpenAPI</a>.</p>
<p>AOL is also releasing <em>Boxely</em> (coming August 2006), which is a toolset of UI elements similar to <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/' title='Yahoo! Developer UI library'>Yahoo!'s UI library</a> (how does one include both a <em>bang</em> and an <em>apostrophe</em> in a possesive noun with punctuation like <em>Yahoo!</em>?)</p>
<p>It's not clear yet what <a href='http://aol.com' title='AOL Homepage'>AOL</a> really has to leverage in terms of bringing in mashup developers. Really someone that wants to get hired/bought. Though being able to better integrate AIM status and location into a site/tool seems really useful. So go to <a href='http://developer.aol.com/'>developer.aol.com</a> and see if anything sparks your imagination. And try not to smirk at AOL's line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
...this is where you'll find the special sauce to build great Web applications.  We want you to hack our stuff.  So mash it up!<br />
