  content: Hey, I just read your article in Make and started looking at Indigo. I've
    been wanting to do home automation for a while and was thinking of implementing
    a Mister House setup. Have you looked at that as well and if so can you shed some
    light on why you went with an Indigo solution? The cost of the software seems
    high. (especially compared to the free MisterHouse) Thanks for the nice article
    in Make, it's made me want to start spending some money on home automation stuff.

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/06/makemagazine_issue10.gif" alt="Make Magazine - Issue 10 Cover" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/>I haven't gotten a chance to blog about it yet, but I'm <em>really</em> excited to point out my article in <a href="http://makezine.com/" title="Make Magazine">Make Magazine</a>, <a href="http://makezine.com/10/robohouse/" title="Makezine: Robohouse" rel="me">My House is a Robot</a>. (hint, it's on page 72, but listed on the cover and featured article in the table of contents).</p>
<p>The article is a beautifully renditioned (thanks <a href="http://www.gregruffing.com/" title="Greg Ruffing: Photojournalist" rel="met">Greg Ruffing</a> and <a href="http://www.l-dopa.com/" title="Nik Schulz's homepage, L-Dopa Design">Nik Schulz</a>) 4-page story of my day and life living in my automated house. It started when I gave a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pechakucha" title="Wikipedia: Pecha Kucha">pecha kucha</a> talk at EuroFOO last September in Brussels. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Dougherty" title="Wikipedia: Dale Dougherty">Dale Dougherty</a> really liked it and introduced me to Bre Pettis, and away I went.</p>
<p>One of the primary points I wanted to convey, but I think was lost in the "artist's rendering" of my house, is how easy and inexpensive the entire setup is. I <em>rent</em> my house, and no, it's not shaped like a huge, 4-story robot, complete with sun deck above my bedroom. :)</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/06/makezine-issue-10-article-page-2.thumbnail.png" title="Make Magazine Article - Robohouse" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/>I hope to do more articles in the future detailing some of the hacks in-depth. This article was fairly high-level and just convey the idea of what is possible and how it can fit into your life in a <em>helpful</em> way (yeah, I know, probably breaks a simple rule of hackerdom, usefulness). I have a series of articles discussing the software side in <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mt_indices/T_Authors.html" title="MacTech Magazine: T-authors" rel="me">MacTech Magazine</a>, but haven't gotten to present the hardware side as much. </p>
<p>And there is more information available in the <a href="http://automation.highearthorbit.com" title="Automation Wiki" rel="me">AutomationWiki</a> with more being added all the time (it's a lot to document). Drop me a comment or email if you have a specific question and I'll try to answer it quickly & put the response up in the wiki. </p>
