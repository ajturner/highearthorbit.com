<p><a href="http://www.rajsingh.org/" title="Raj Singh's Home Page" rel="met">Raj Singh</a> pointed out this document from Nokia on their <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/9001c8de-c19e-41a0-87d3-5be4297e4d4c/S60_Platform_Landmarks_Exchange_Specification_v1_0_en.pdf.html" title="Resource information: S60 Platform: Landmarks Exchange Format Specification">Landmark Exchange Format Specification</a>. It's an XML definition for sharing locations between mobile users - originally spec'd September 2005. </p>
<p>This is a really great idea. The doc contains some nice layout of use-cases for mobile users sharing and loading landmarks. I should be able to easily send someone a location, especially <em>my location</em>, our meeting spot, a great hike, or whatever. However, it's not clear why Nokia defined their own specification. Or at least, why would they continue to push their own specification. </p>
<p>One of the purposes is interoperability - as stated in the specification:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Landmark messaging should work across different manufacturers' devices. This specification is open and license-free and allows incorporating the functionality to different software platforms and interoperable Java MIDP landmark messaging applications for the devices of other manufacturers.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>While the specification is "open and license-free" it is still controlled by Nokia. Look at the MIME-type: <code>application/vnd.nokia.landmarkcollection+xml</code>. What that means is that while you are free to <em>use</em> the spec, you probably won't have any say in the format if you need some functionality or find a problem.</p>
<p>Now compare to a location-documentation format like KML. Now, to be fair, KML wasn't as ubiquitous in 2005 (or the year Nokia was probably working on their spec), and the MIME-type of KML is still <code>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</code>. However, KML is now undergoing external standards adoption, and will be outside the specific control of a single entity, Google. </p>
<h3>More than just ownership</h3><br />
While allowing community input into a format is nice, there are more reasons to use a more widely used format like KML - namely that it's <em>more widely used</em> and therefore there are a lot of clients and services that can make use of the format. More players means more fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/index.html" title="Sports Tracker | Nokia Research Center">Nokia's Sports Tracker</a> app does export KML, as well as GPX. This makes it very nice to email, share, and upload your hikes or workouts. Perhaps this is a trial for them. However you can't load KML into Sports Tracker to follow someone else's track. </p>
<p>Here's to hoping that Nokia supports KML and even GeoRSS for subscribing to a source of location information (such as a stream of sensor data or friends' locations). </p>
