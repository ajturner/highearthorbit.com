<p>The NYT has an <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/16/technology/circuits/16gpss.html?oref=login'>article about GPS enabled photography</a> (forgoing of first-born child required). They cite <a href='http://www.remote.org/frederik/'>Frederik Ramm</a> from Karlsruhe and his trip around Northern Scotland. The other is <a href='http://www.adelman.com/'>Kenneth and Gabrielle Adelman</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, neither have geolocation information in their headers. Have to see if they're using geographic info in their EXIF data. </p>
