  content: "\r\n\r\nIterate, I'm sure, is the only answer.  You do the best you can
    with the tools you have close at hand right now, and think about how things might
    be better the next time.\r\n\r\nI've been very impressed throughout all of this
    with the power of a good radio network - for one because it has a reach to people
    who don't have computer access or reliable power, and for two because properly
    prepared it can do field information gathering and vetting at a much larger scale
    than any individual can manage."

<p>Like a good geo geek I spent my "holiday" digging fast and deep to contribute to the <a href="http://gustav08.ning.com/" title="The Hurricane Information Center">community</a> around providing information assistance and monitoring around Gustav's path through Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Louisiana. The result was a quick prototype map: <a href="http://crescentmaps.org/gustav/" title="Hurricane Gustav evacuation and shelters">http://crescentmaps.org/gustav/</a>.</p>
<p>There were several issues at hand - one was the lack of available, accessible data. I started adding data sources to the wiki page, and when available uploaded them to <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/searches?query=gustav" title="">GeoCommons Finder! tagged 'gustav'</a>. Sean offers great reasons on the <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/08/31/geodata-for-gustav-why-effective-information-sharing-is-critical-during-disasters/" title="GeoData for Gustav - Why Effective Information Sharing is Critical During Disasters | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">importance of data sharing</a> (and some more really great previews of <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons Maker">Maker!</a>).</p><iframe src="http://mapufacture.com/maps/2936?viz=embed" height="400px" width="500px"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/gustav-social-m.html" title="Vacuum - Edward Vielmetti in Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104: Gustav: social media lessons being learned">Ed shares his thoughts</a> on the overall experience and also questions the impact? Having spoken often with people such as Jesse Robbins and Mikel on their work in helping out in disaster response technology development and deployment the primary lesson I've picked up is: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/etech2008-disastertech-robbins-maron-20080305a" title="ETech2008 DisasterTech Robbins Maron 20080305a">iterate</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Gustav fading out does not mean everything is clear and over. New Orlean citizens are still not supposed to come back into the city, there are still <a href="http://entergy-neworleans.com/outages/nola.aspx" title="Entergy Storm Center">major power outages</a>, and there was already a huge amount of work continuing from the Katrina recovery. There has been a <a href="http://twitter.com/NoOneYouKnow/statuses/905805480" title="Twitter / Adam Zand: @acarvin @randomdeanna Woul...">marked neglect of public assistance</a> on non-US regions such as Cuba and the DR. In addition, there are more storms coming up this season - so make sure and <a href="http://gustav08.ning.com/" title="The Hurricane Information Center">pitch in to help</a> out if you can.</p>
