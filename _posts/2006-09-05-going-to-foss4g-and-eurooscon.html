<p>I've been rather busy making last minute plans for going to the <a href='http://www.foss4g2006.org/' title='FOSS4G Website'>Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Information Systems</a> (FOSS4GIS) conference in <span class="adr"><a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=lausanne,+switzerland&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A' title='GoogleMaps for Lausanne, Switzerland'><span class="locality">Lausanne</span>, <span class="country-name">Switzerland</span></a></span> next week. This was long-time in thinking about going, and short-time in actually getting planning together</p>
<p>My talk is titled <span class="vcalendar"><span class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=189&sessionId=46&confId=1"><span class="summary">Enabling Users to Produce personalized Geodata</span>, <span class="dtstart" title="2006-09-15T10:00:00+01:00">on Friday, September 15 at 10AM (Central European Time)</span><span class="dtend" title="2006-09-15T11:00:00+01:00"></span></a></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p> This paper will cover the implementation, features, and applications of GeoPress, and how it serves the larger purpose of allowing users to create their own geodata. GeoPress is being developed to demonstrate and promote the GeoRSS standard.</p>
<p>A common problem in the online cartography is that currently available tools do not provide an easy way for people to quickly and easily produce and consume geodata. Additionally, blogging is an incredibly increasing means for people to generate content and attach various metadata. This paper discusses the implementation and use of a tool that enables bloggers to quickly add geodata to their blog posts. </p>
<p>GeoPress is a Wordpress plugin that provides address geocoding, GPX track upload, and a clickable map interface to allow a Wordpress user to mark locations, tracks, and areas and add this information to a blog post. Using such a tool, users can quickly create geodata describing trips, tours, favorite locales, photos, and stories.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by then generating a standardized GeoRSS feed from their blog, users then enable other services such as Mapufacture or Yahoo!, to consume, map, and aggregate this geodata. GeoPress itself is also able to consume GeoRSS feeds, which can then be added to a users blog, or used to mark blog posts. Enabling tools such as GeoPress will fill the world with freely available geographic information.</blockquote></p>
<p>So specifically I'll be presenting <a href='http://georss.org/trac/' title='GeoRSS.org trac wiki'>GeoPress</a>, a Wordpress plugin that allows you to attach Geographic coordinates to blog entries, output GeoRSS in your feeds, and embed dynamic maps. It is just one example of how easy it is to produce (and consume) geographic data and release it into the public. </p>
<p>After that I'll be jaunting up to <a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/' title="O'Reilly EuroOSCON Conference">O'Reilly's EuroOSCON</a> in <span class="adr"><a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Brussels,+Belgium&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A' title='GoogleMaps for Brussels, Belgium'><span class="locality">Brussels</span>, <span class="country-name">Belgium</span></a></span> for a couple of days. Both conferences should be a, and I state firmly, <strong>ton of fun</strong>. I'll post updates on the road (or airways/trainways)</p>
