<p>While setting up my new <a href='http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net'>Misterhouse</a> server (which works rather well from my Mac to my Audrey so far), I found a reference to the <a href='http://www.redrat.co.uk/'>USB RedRat3</a>. It is an IR controller via USB (obviously). I want to use this little device to startup my Roomba every morning. The ability to schedule cleaning times and lengths in the roomba is a serious shortcoming in a robotic device. This Redrat should do the trick. However, another problem with the roomba is that you can only send it back to the base by pressing two buttons <str>on the Roomba</str> and not via remote. </p>
<p>The idea of using an IR remote on a device that is designed to go <em>under</em> things seems short-sighted and/or cheap. </p>
