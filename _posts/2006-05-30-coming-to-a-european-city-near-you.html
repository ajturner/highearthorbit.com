    support in Va this past week! \r\nI probably will not in the European locations

<p>Tomorrow I fly out on a short jaunt about the great continent of Europe. A little sightseeing, and also following around the <a href='http://verdantconcepts.com/blog'>great Environmentalist</a> I call my <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/32240915/'>Fiancee</a> to a conference in Vienna. </p>
<p>Our itinerary is approximately the following - but subject to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Munich, Germany - June 1-2</li>
<li>Prague, Czech Republich - June 3-5</li>
<li>Vienna, Austria - June 7-11</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>So, if you are in or around those locations in the next couple of weeks, drop me an email to <a href='mailto:travel@highearthorbit.com'>travel@highearthorbit.com</a> and I'll buy the first round. </p>
