<p><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/mactalk_magazine.thumbnail.jpg" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/><a href="http://mag.mactalk.com.au/">MacTalk Magazine</a> is a new, print & digital magazine out of Australia. If you don't happen to be down-under, you can grab the PDF for free. (via <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/338">Theocacao</a>)</p>
<p>Overall it has a very nice layout, though I think there could be a <em>little</em> more line-spacing. The Short story sections that look like Safari windows is cute though the double-url's is redundant.</p>
<p>One thing about Mac magazines, there are quite a few out there now, and to be honest, the community just <em>isn't that big</em> to warrant 4 or 5 monthly magazines. Especially when there are so many blogs. Really, you end up getting multiple reviews on the same new products, like an external hard drive. And which magazine is going to give a <em>bad</em> review of a new piece of Apple hardware. </p>
<p>Mac Talk also has non-mac specific articles, like Depth of Field for photography, and better movie recording techniques. There is even a Programming section, which is very welcome, but perhaps a little bit out of the mainstream.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the idea of various levels of Mac Magazines. You have your general audience magazine, like MacAddict or MacWorld. There is the sole surviving technical magazine, MacTech, and various photography and media Mac magazines. </p>
<p>I'm curious as to the readership trends of print magazines to online resources, and how magazines can better blend the two. Wired, for example, published their print magazine (of which I am a subscriber) with all of their articles, and excellent layout. However, they also push their articles out online, staged, after the print magazine. Sometimes the online article comes out before I've gotten a chance to read the print version. This is a case of the magazine still providing the easy to use, and pretty print magazine, but gaining a wider readership and use to the community by also publishing online. </p>
<p>Personally, I get a large amount of traffic through my articles that have been published online through <a href="interactive.linuxjournal.com/node/8025/" title="Geotagging Web Pages and RSS Feeds | Linux Journal" rel="me">Linux Journal</a>, whereas I don't know the amount of <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech-synopses/304420-21.09-AMacMiniRobot-Synopsis.html" title="Building A Vision Capable Robot Using A Mac mini Computer| MacTech Magazine" rel="me">MacTech</a>-inspired readers I get. </p>
<p>I hope more (all) magazines follow the trend of publishing their articles online. </p>
