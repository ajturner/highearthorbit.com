<p>Tomorrow I fly out to Victoria, British Columbia for next week's <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/" title="FOSS4G 2007 : Home">FOSS4G conference</a> (Free and Open-Source Software for Geoinformatics). </p>
<p>On Tuesday I'm giving <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/plenaries/lightning/" title="FOSS4G 2007 : Lightning Talks">a lightning talk</a>, "Beyond GPS - Neogeography Data Collection". I'll give a quick overview of what people are now starting to map with for aerial imaging, environmental monitoring, traffic, mileage, and more. The conference looks really great - particularly because it's covering the future of a number of subjects I'm interested and participating in such as <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=242" title="FOSS4G 2007 : Using the Atom Publishing Protocol for Web GIS">APP</a>, <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=7" title="FOSS4G 2007 : Pleiades: Building a RESTful, Open Source GIS for the Humanities">REST</a>, <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=207" title="FOSS4G 2007 : GeoRSS as RNA in SDI: Using Feeds to enable Geospatial Federation">GeoRSS</a>, <a href="http://www.foss4g2007.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=154" title="FOSS4G 2007 : Painless feature markup in KML">KML</a>, and more.</p>
<p>I'm going early because over the weekend we're having a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Victoria_mapping_party">OpenStreetMap Victoria Mapping Party</a>. This will be my first OSM Mapping Party - but I've heard great things about them, and always lots of Pub time after the good workout. </p>
<p>The map below is the OpenStreetMap coverage of Victoria. I'm embedding it using <a href="http://georss.org/geopress" title="GeoPress | GeoRSS ::  Geographically Encoded Objects for RSS feeds">GeoPress</a> and <a href="http://www.mapstraction.com/" title="Mapstraction - a javascript library to hide differences between mapping APIs.">Mapstraction</a> (end plug). If you read this post before Sunday, September 23, 2007 you'll see a several holes in the coverage of roads. Hopefully, after this Sunday you'll see nearly complete coverage. </p>
<p>And if you're in the area of Victoria (either side of the border) this weekend or Monday, then definitely stop in with or without a GPS receiver to join in on the fun.</p>
