<p>Earlier I <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/web-based-os-desktops/">discussed Web-based Desktop Interfaces</a> which do lots of various tricks in lots of various ways to provide a consistent (at least with respect to computer users') user experience. How do they do that you ask?</p>
<p>Here is a very nice <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/slider/slider.html">javascript slider</a>. It's released under various licenses including GPL, a non-commerical free license, and a commerical $ license. </p>
<p>It's very simple to use, requires including 3 javascript files (24k) and a css file. Check the docs out for more info. While there, checkout their other cool UI elements such as collapsable trees, sortable columns, and very good articles on a host of web development technologies.</p>
<p>The same developers also produce <a href='http://www.bindows.net/'>Bindows</a>, which is a full, desktop type set of user interface elements usable to create an entire application interface. It's a little on the expensive side for a commercial license. However, doing these elements on your own dev time, and making them fast and cross-browser compatible is <em>not</em> going to be easy.</p>
<p>You can also check out the <a href='http://script.aculo.us/'>Script.aculo.us</a> - the modern, cool Javascript library built on <a href='http://prototype.conio.net/'>Prototype</a> <a href='http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/SliderDemo'>SliderDemo</a>Other Javascript interface libraries:</p>
