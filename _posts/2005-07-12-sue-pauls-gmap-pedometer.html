  content: "Just a pointer to TrailRunner. It's also a route planning software. \r\n\r\nTrailRunner
    will import GPX-tracklogs from GPS receivers and then plot the data on a map.
    Within the map, TrailRunner can then calculate routes for a given distance. \r\n\r\nYou
    can even export directions as small NanoMaps to your iPod nano, journalize in
    a diary you can publish as a weblog and improve your performance with the build
    in exercise plan. \r\n\r\nTrailRunner runs on Mac OS X and is free!\r\n"

  content: This is the coolest site.  Thank you.  I do have a question.  I'm able
    to route anywhere in the U.S. but cannot connect to any outside countries.  I
    tried Vatican City and others but to no avail.

<p>Sue & Paul's <a href='http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/'>gMapPedometer</a> is a pretty simple, but slick use of the GoogleMaps API to produce what they call a pedometer. You can 'Start Recording', double-click points on the map and the route is built-up, points added and plotted out and the total distance calculated.</p>
<p>This kind of interface for building a route, perhaps adding some notes, pictures, movie, audio, etc. and then saving the "permalink" for friends and such is great. An easy way to build up a guided tour.</p>
