<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4040387/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1/4040387_4ebcf573b4_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="CurlingStone" align='right' hspace='5px' vspace='5px'/></a>Yesterday was quite a wash for me as I spent the day glued to the <a href='http://mythtv.org'>MythTV</a> watching and catching up on <a href='http://detroitcurlingclub.com'>curling</a> for the US Men & Women. </p>
<p>One of my friends asked me: "Do you think you could beat the [US] men's curling team" to which I said, and was reinforced yesterday "he** no". They played incredibly well, though almost blew it a couple of times vs. <strike>Scotland</strike> Great Britain, despite having gotten 4 in the 3rd end.</p>
<p>The US Women, on the other hand, are not doing so well. I think my competitive team would have a shot against them. They've been playing better the last couple of games (which I saw all of) but apparently just missed enough rolls and hits in the first couple of games to lose too many of their games(which I guess I'm not sorry I missed). </p>
<p>A really odd, an entirely unexpected side effect of curling. Whenever I watch speed skating, or figure skating, I absolutely cringe and crawl out of my skin whenever I see someone chip the ice. I keep thinking - oh that's going to take <em>forever</em> to fix. </p>
