<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/CzechFlag.jpg' alt='Czech Flag' align='right' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' border='1px'/>While talking a walk about our pleasant town, <a href='http://greenroof.highearthorbit.com'>my girlfriend</a> and wandered up some dirt paths to the upper hills of the town. Despite being on<a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0298203/'>"8-mile"</a>, we live about --> < -- this far from horse farms and cattle. And where we're walking is *unpaved*. There are some nice houses, a lot more woods, very pleasant in general. We didn't expect what happened next.</p>
<p>After rounding a bend, we come to a wall that is 6 feet high. At the top of said wall is a fence, about another 8 feet high, with many signs to the effect of "Security system in place, video surveillance, yada, yada, yada..." Way up the hill we see a HUGE mansion, which spurs discussions of "wouldn't it be nice to have that much money to own a mansion of that size?" Of course, this is tempered by the fact that we wouldn't actually be interested in owning, maintaining, caring for, getting lost in such a abode, just that it'd be nice to "try out".</p>
<p>We keep walking along the grounds until we come to a large set of gates which are slowly opening to let a black SUV out, and then automatically close behind them. As the gates close, the sunlight flashes off of a large plate on the gate. We step closer to read:</p>
<p>--<br />
Consulate of the Czech Republic<br />
Konzul&Atilde;&iexcl;t &Auml;&OElig;esk&Atilde;&copy; republiky<br />
--</p>
<p>It's also then that we notice the guard shed next to this gate and guard *in* the guard shed next to this gate, watching *us* very closely. We wave, smile, and walk back down the unpaved road. We never realized we lived so close to the Czech Republic. </p>

<p>Question: so do I file this at <a href='    www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=42.433&lon=-83.4913&scale=5000&icon=x'>42.433 x -83.4913</a> or  <a href='www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.0785&lon=14.4423&scale=1000000&icon=x'>50.0785 x 14.4423</a><br />
Epilogue:<br />
Curious, I spent the morning looking up *why* there was a large consulate facility located remotely in a small suburb outside Detroit.<br />
Exhibit A:<br />
