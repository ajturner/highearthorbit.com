<p><a href='http://www.inveneo.org/?q=hardware#pc'>Inveneo</a> has released some good guidance and specs for <a href='http://www.inveneo.org/?q=hardware#pc'>a low-powered computer</a> primarily aimed at rural areas, but really applicable to any number of users who want to compute for less (power).  (via <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/15/inveneo-communications-systems-it-hardware-uses-alternate-energy/'>Engadget</a>)</p>
<p>Using all COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) parts, one can build a good, wifi-enabled, computer and VOIP station. Combine these computer specs with the free and distributable <a href='http://wndw.net/'>Wireless Networks in the Developing World</a>, and you have very <em>ubiquitous</em>, low-barrier to entry, computing. (via <a href='http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/27/howto_build_sustaina.html'>Boing-Boing</a>)</p>
<p>The total power is claimed to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer: 10W</li>
<li>Display: 10W</li>
<li>Wifi: 3W</li>
<li>VOIP SIP (phone) connection: 2-3W</li>
<li><strong>Total: 26W</strong></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Of course, the <a href='http://www.home.earthlink.net/~silasb/macbat/'>MacMini</a> is purported to require only about 25W on idle, up to 40W working (without display or VOIP), and a Powerbook about 15W (30W on heavy usage). </p>
