<p>I just read <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/etech_linda_stone_1.html' title='Transcript of Linda Stone's Talk at Etech 2006'>Transcript of Linda Stone Talk at Etech 2006</a> on <em>Attention: The Real Aphrodisiac</em>, which was an excellent presentation of what she calls <em>Continuous Partial Attention</em>. I imagine anyone reading this blog/entry knows what she's talking about.</p>
<p>I also found the following quote by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Hock' title='Dee Hock Wikipedia entry'>Dee Hock</a> (founder of Visa), back in 1996, very insightful with regards to the huge amount of data we face daily and maybe some ideas on how to make it all useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noise becomes data when it has a cognitive pattern.</li>
<li>Data becomes information when assembled into a coherent whole, which can be related to other information.</li>
<li>Information becomes knowledge when integrated with other information in a form useful for making decisions and determining actions.</li>
<li>Knowledge becomes understanding when related to other knowledge in a manner useful in anticipating, judging and acting.</li>
<li>Understanding becomes wisdom when informed by purpose, ethics, principles, memory and projection.</li><br />
</ul></p>
