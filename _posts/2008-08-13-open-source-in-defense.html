  content: I'm not sure if you're familiar with FalconView, but Georgia Tech is working
    to release an open source version of the popular mission planning tool.  I'll
    be posting details on my blog as they come available.  The long and short of it
    is that, hopefully, FalconView will gain popularity beyond its traditional DoD
    users and will be available as a piece of GIS software for the public-at-large.

<p>One of the more interesting presentations and discussions at BarCamp.mil was the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/cio-nii/cio/" title="DoD CIO - Homepage">Department of Defense CIO</a> thoughts on a future publicized guidance on the use and promotion of open-source software for defense contracts.</p>
<p>Open-source in the DoD <a href="http://www.gcn.com/print/22_15/22425-1.html" title="">isn't new</a>. In fact, there have been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060820-7545.html" title="Department of Defense study urges open source adoption">government reports</a> that call for the DoD to issue an official strategy for utilizing open-source. The issue is particularly unclear in recent light of the US Government <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/04/2253246" title="Slashdot | USAF Violates DMCA, Escapes Unscathed">being declared</a> a sovereign entity outside of copyright law.</p>
<p>The objective of the prospective official guidance would be to outline both the benefits of using open-source in defense as well as provide understanding on the effects to contractors and bids. It is vital that contracts are clear on the legal implications and responsibilities of providers.</p>
<p>So far, this has meant that solution providers are not necessarily willing to wade through the uncharted waters and instead deliver proprietary software. In addition, there was no impetus to use open-source, since by shipping proprietary software the effect is to lock-in the provider for decades.</p>
<p>In addition, there needs to be a defined mechanism for how accepted open-source software that comes inside various government offices, especially defense and intelligence organizations, be re-released to the community. Currently I've seen a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellipedia" title="Intellipedia - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">open-source projects</a> taken into agencies and essentially forked since the code will never be able to be released due to concerns of potential security leaks in the code itself.</p>
<p>In the open-source world, a government supported promotion of its use would have dramatic effects. Looking at the current state of commercial company support for projects such as <a href="http://www.apache.org/" title="Welcome! - The Apache Software Foundation">Apache</a>, Linux, Gnome, <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/" title="OSGeo.org | Your Open Source Compass">OSGeo</a> and more demonstrate that there is clear benefit to be gained. If the government then pushes open-source there would a huge upsurge in the support of projects and communities.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping the lobbyist groups don't head this off before it makes it to the light of day.</p>
