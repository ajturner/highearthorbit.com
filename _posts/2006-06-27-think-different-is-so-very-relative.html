  content: "So did RailsConf reward the diligent PC users?  Or perhaps the lone sucker
    carrying around an SGI?  :)\r\n\r\nI think that what Apple was *really* trying
    to say was more like, \"Think Inspired\" or perhaps \"Think Different-in-a-Better-Way.\"
    \ However, the first is cliche, and the latter just doesn't fit on a bumper sticker
    if you insist on a reasonable font size.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes:  is Apple
    still thinking different?  Or has the Apple laptop stonewalled itself, in the
    same way as the PC?  \r\n  --> Where are the Apple handheld devices (I know, they
    tried that a _long_ time ago and it bombed, but Steve, really, try it again!)?\r\n
    \ --> Where are the Apple tablet interfaces?  \r\n\r\nI love the Mac/PC personified
    ad campaign, but what if I want my Mac to do something more than work out of the
    box, interface with my new camera, and publish web pages?"

  content: I just happen to come across your webpage and I thought the comment about
    Apple handheld devices was funny. Here in 2008 (2 years later) I guess Apple really
    still does "Think Different".

However, it now means something very different in certain venues. I've noticed this trend growing steadily as I attend conferences, but I don't think I've heard it as pronounced (at a non-apple specific meeting) as it was at this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
By our best estimates, over 90% of the 550 people at RailsConf 2006 are using Apple laptops.</p>
<p>We decided to reward those willing to take a stand against the norm and compute different.<br />
