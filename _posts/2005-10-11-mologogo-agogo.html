<p><a href='http://www.mologogo.com'>Mologogo</a> is another social mapping/tracking web service app. This is the same vein as <a href='http://plazes.com/'>Plazes</a>, <a href='http://www.streethive.com/'>StreetHive</a>, <a href='http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/buddyspace/'>BuddySpace</a>, and my own <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location'>Travelog</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is their coded up Java client to install on a Nextel (only) phone for uploading your location. This is again nothing new, since there are other apps out there that will grab from a bluetooth GPS or user inputted coordinates and upload via a phone. But they point out that one can purchase a "pay as you go" nextel phone for cheap that has built-in GPS-like capability.</p>
