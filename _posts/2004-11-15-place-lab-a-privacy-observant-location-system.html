<p>Looks like they got this thing all wrapped up. ;) but really, looks like a pretty cool start. Now if I can just figure out how to run these silly java apps.</p>
<p>They also use <a href="http://www.wigle.net/">wigle.net</a>, which is Wireless Geographic Logging Engine, Plotting WiFi on Maps. This looks like a really cool resource for wifi maps around the U.S. Not sure about abroad yet, I'll have to dig around some more. hrm, again, I wonder if there is a feed or something someone could grab and use in the SpyTrack Geo-Aggregator (need a better name).</p>
