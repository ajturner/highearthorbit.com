  content: Very nice presentation (I went and watched the video too). Geohashing in
    particular caught my fancy, since I'm investigating a solution to a similar problem...

<p>Last week I was fortunate to speak at the much lauded Future of Web Apps London (FOWA). Ryan Carson and his team put on a well-crafted conference with a great line-up of speakers such as <a href="http://romeda.org/" title="Liminal Existence">Blaine</a>, <a href="http://kevinrose.com/" title="this is my website | Kevin Rose - blogg">Kevin</a>, <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/" title="hackdiary">Matt</a> and <a href="http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/speakers" title="Future of Web Apps Expo | Speakers">more</a>.</p>
<p>I was the only geo related talk, with quite a broad title "Beyond GoogleMaps". The space is quite broad and is <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/where20-radar-report/" title="Where2.0 Radar Report :: High Earth Orbit">evolving quickly</a>. Especially coming from a series of conferences at <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/trends-and-technologies-in-where20/" title="Trends and Technologies in Where2.0 :: High Earth Orbit" rel="me">Web2.0 Expo New York</a> and <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/presentation-rebuilding-a-city-through-community-neogeography-and-gis/" title="Presentation: 'Rebuilding a City through Community, Neogeography, and GIS&acirc;&euro; :: High Earth Orbit" rel="me">FOSS4G</a> in Cape Town, in addition to the work we're doing on <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons - Visual Analytics through Maps">GeoCommons</a>, there was a bevy of new concepts and technologies that we worth highlighting.</p>
<p>As for the title, I actually didn't pick it (or at least don't remember choosing it). In fact, I think Google has done tremendous strides in pushing web mapping through their own toolkits and applications. GoogleMaps has some advanced capabilities such as interface styling, alternate tilesets, encoded and simplified geometries, and flash interface. However, a strident claims gain interest and again the purpose was to engage developers to look beyond just slapping a map up on a site and calling it done. They really need to consider the usability, accessibility, and design of their cartographic interface as much as any other component.</p>

<p>My goal with the talk was to inspire developers and designers to play with new tools, and for managers to realize what is possible and appropriate and spur their teams into creating compelling applications with geospatial capabilities. The actual implementation of this desk was 201 slides in less than 40 minutes. One attendee commented afterwards that it was like "watching a del.icio.us stream." The 178 slides in the uploaded deck have the "Nonline" and AtomPub slides removed. I did not give proper coverage of these major issues and in the end felt they were best left out of this deck.</p>
<p>I concur that overall the presentation is was quite fast. I hope it was inspiring and enjoyable and that people walked away eager to find out more about the possibilities of web mapping. Fortunately you can get the <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2008/london/videos/andrew-turner" title="Future Of Web Apps - London 2008">full video</a> and highlights and watch at half or quarter speed. You can also get the <a href="http://slideshare.net/ajturner/beyond-google-maps-fowa-lo-presentation/" title="Beyond Google Maps - FOWA 2008 London">slide deck</a>.</p>
<p>I actually have some plans for this presentation to expand out into a better and discoverable walk-through of mapping technologies. Stay tuned. And thanks <a href="http://carsonified.com/" title="Carsonified">Carsonified</a> and the <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/about-us" title="Carsonified &Acirc;&raquo; A little bit about us &acirc;&euro;&brvbar;">FOWA team</a>!</p>
