<p>The <a href='http://www.ipa.go.jp/index-e.html'>Japanese Information-technology Promotion Agency</a> is a new agency that is supporting open-source and other IT projects. </p>
<p>Their official purpose:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 The objective of IPA is to promote the development of information technology through (i) supporting the development and greater use of innovative software; (ii) ensuring lT security and reliability; (iii) assisting the business development of information service providers; (iv) developing lT skills and knowledge; and (iv) conducting Information Technology Engineers Examination.<br />
</blockquote></p>
