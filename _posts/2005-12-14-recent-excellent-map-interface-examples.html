<p>Various mashups and the ilk have been fast-and-furious in the past year. I've played around with my own map-application interfaces, while also appreciating many of the various schemes for UI that have popped up. The following is a short coverage of some of the nice interfaces I've come across. </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/WindowsLocalLive.JPG' ><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-WindowsLocalLive.JPG' alt='Windows Local Live Interface' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' align='right'/></a><a href='http://local.live.com/'>Windows Live Local</a> is the newly rebranded Virtual Earth (think Keyhole->GoogleMaps). It has some nice overlays, the ability to add pushpins with annotations, tours, and <em>ooh</em>, right-click support. </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/wayfaring.JPG'><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-wayfaring.JPG' alt='Wayfaring interface' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' align='right'/></a><a href='http://wayfaring.com/'>Wayfaring</a> is a Ruby/Rails web application utilizing GoogleMaps. It's got a very nice layout with map, set of links along the right-hand side, comments below, and the ability to handle tracks. </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/HLO_Mapping_full.jpg' ><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-HLO_Mapping_full.jpg' alt='Hunting Legacy Online Interface' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' align='right'/></a><a href='http://www.huntinglegacyonline.com'>Hunting Legacy Online</a>, despite its unlikeable (to me) subject matter, looks like a really nice interface for creating map annotations, layers, etc. The purpose is to tell a history of your hunting trips. However, the same premise could be used for geneology, family trips, photographic shoots, etc. </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/Mapserver.JPG' ><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-Mapserver.JPG' alt='Maps for Mapserver' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' align='right'/></a><a href='http://maps.dmsolutions.ca/demo/us_streets/'>Maps for Mapserver</a> is a very slick interface for mapserver, which is typically static. It doesn't have many bells and whistles, but is a great demonstration that you don't need to be locked into one of the "Big Three" (of online maps) in order to have a nice mapping interface. They use <a href='http://www.maptools.org/'>MapTools</a> to perform the GIS magic. </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/Waymarking.JPG'><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-Waymarking.JPG' alt='Waymarking interface'  hspace='10px' vspace='10px' align='right'/></a><a href='http://www.waymarking.com/'>Waymarking</a> is using static Tiger maps currently, but i'm a fan of their sidebars and isometric icon graphics. </p>
