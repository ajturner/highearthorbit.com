<p>Well, I've now entered my <em>late Twenties</em> (27 to all you people that can't figger it out, {20} = twenty, {21,22,23} = early twenties, {24,25,26} = mid-twenties, {27,28,29}) Ah the humanity.</p>
<p>But I got to try out a, IMHO, very excellent japanese/french restaurant. <a href='http://www.shiro-restaurant.com/'>Shiro</a> locate in Novi, Michigan (check the geo info for a map) It's a very interesting converted mansion with plenty of nice dining space. Supposedly there are tatami mat rooms in the basement, but you need a group of 10+ to reserve it. :p</p>
<p>Besides some good buckwheat noodles, a little crispy eel sashimi, I got to try an excellent saki <a href='http://www.quantobasta.com/detail/5920/Otokoyama+Sake+1.8Liter.html'>Otokoyama</a>. </p>
