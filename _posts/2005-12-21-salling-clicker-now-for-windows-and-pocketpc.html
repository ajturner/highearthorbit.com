<p><a href="http://www.salling.com/">Salling Clicker</a> just made it to version 3.0. And the biggest change: it now <a href='http://www.salling.com/Clicker/windows/'>runs on windows and PocketPC</a>. </p>
<p>This was a really smart move for the product - as there is obviously a huge market, with no other great solution like this. I was having trouble with my iPaq 1945 - turns out the battery went completely <em>kaput</em>, so I ordered a new pair for $4.95 (plus $10 S&H - go figure) off of eBay, and it's back to new.</p>
<p>So I quickly tossed on the demo version of Salling Clicker, and it's great. I must use Windows for work - so being able to have all the remote interface, and bluetooth interface goodness on my work machine is a little slice of heaven. Almost makes up for not having a Mac on my desk... almost, <em>but not quite</em></p>
<p>In case you didn't know - Salling Clicker is a bluetooth or Wifi interface UI for accessing and operating your computer from a Pocket device (Palm or PocketPC), or your mobile phone. It's well known for allowing people to control their powerpoint presentations from their cellphones instead of a dedicated remote.</p>
<p>However, Salling Clicker also allows one to: stop/play/view cover art in iTunes, control the mouse, lock/unlock your computer when you walk away or approach, and is completely scriptable. </p>
<p>For example, on my home mac (and soon to be work mac), I have scripts that when my cellphone approaches and connects, it changes my <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location">travelogue</a> location to the correct place. </p>
