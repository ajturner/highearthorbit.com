<p>Tonight's beer, brought to us by the Florida Beer Company of Melbourne, FL. </p>
<blockquote><p>Keywest Ale is an American medium bodied Amber ale with a tropical twist. It is brewed with pale and caramel malts, blended with hops, to create a crisp, satisfying taste.</blockquote></p>
<p>Hrm, I don't know if the label could have said less in so many words. I mean, what does a "tropical twist mean"? And I sure hope it's a satisfying taste. What kind of beer claims itself to be a "soft, wimpy, unenjoyable taste"?</p>
<p>Anyways, it's all the local liquor store had that wasn't of the "Standard US National Variety" (tm). I find it enjoyable, especially when sipped on a veranda overlooking the beach after a long day in a conventional hall. The taste is a little undefinable (read smooth, but indestinct) with a slight sweet tang at the end (perhaps that's the aforementioned tropical twist).</p>
<p>I rate thee: 3/5</p>
