  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI saw your blog entry on A2B (even though it was a couple of
    months ago now), and I thought you might be interested in the following features:\r\n\r\n1.
    Search by lat/long in URL\r\ne.g. http://www.a2b.cc/search-latlong.a2b?lat=41.159508&long=-112.035633\r\n\r\n2.
    DIY \"Search A2B\" mapping feature (in some kind of testing at the moment)\r\nhttp://forum.a2b.cc/viewtopic.php?t=25\r\n\r\nWe
    also do RSS feeds now (although we're having some problems with character sets
    given the huge range of international characters in the A2B database).\r\n\r\nDrop
    me a mail if you need to know more, look at http://www.a2b.cc or post
    a message on the forums at http://forum.a2b.cc. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nSam"

<p><a href='http://pingomatic.com/blog/2004/11/14/announcing-a2b-geolocation-support/'>Ping-o-Matic</a> offers Geolocation Support via <a href='http://www.a2b.cc/'>A2B Location Services</a>. This seems to replace the old GeoURL service, which I was wondering why it had disappeared off the face of the planet. </p>
<p>Essentially, it is a repository of websites/blogs based on geographical location. What seems useful is if the A2B service can also verify/grab information from websites that offer the geolocation in their website header ala:</p>
<p><meta name='geo.position' content="42.4266;-83.49307" /></p>
<p>There currently is no map or anything, just a listing of the 'nearest' sites and their links. Also, no description of the site. What about adding tags/genres or integrating this with del.icio.us?</p>
<p>I'll see about adding this as a service in GeolocationMenulet (i.e. "Websites near this location") as well as see if there is an RSS feed that can be used in the SpyTrack Geo-Aggregator.</meta></p>
