Erle">hackers</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be holding a series of talks on software tools, data formats, techniques, and scholarship of geospatial data. The institute is accepting applications for attendees until September 1 - so you can apply through the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/geospatial" title="Scholars' Lab - Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship">UVA Scholar's Lab</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Through the generosity of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Scholars' Lab will host a three-track <b>Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship</b> at the University of Virginia Library in November 2009 and May 2010. This Institute will bring scholars, cultural heritage professionals, and software developers together to support and develop geospatial projects and methods in the digital humanities. The NEH's <a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/IATDH.html">Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities</a> program will support travel and lodging for 40 attendees as well as Institute faculty members. Dedicated funding is available for graduate students as well as faculty attendees.<br />

In addition, to cap off the institute, I will be giving the GIS Day Plenary talk on Wednesday, November 18 in Charlottesville, VA. The event will be open to the public.</p>
<p>It's truly an honor to be teaching at my <a href="http://virginia.edu/" title="University of Virginia">alma mater</a> - albeit in quite a different discipline than the one I learned while attending.</p>
