  content: I think your analysis of the needs is right on. There is an entire spectrum
    of the crisis metadata initiative (ushahidi, instedd) that is being led by the
    shared lessons of neogeography.

  content: "Andrew:\r\n\r\nI don't buy the linkage between neogeography and the \"loss
    of cartography\".  For every default red google maps icon, there is an ArcMap
    hardcopy product clearly the fruit of a default color ramp.  Further, GYM web
    maps clearly consider cartography and distinguishing characteristic:  look how
    the \"professional\" GIS company upgraded the cartography on their own web service
    basemaps in the face of new competition.\r\n\r\nWe all can distinguish an Excel
    chart that was clearly a \"Next-->Next-->Finish\" wizard job.  And we can see
    the ArcMap equivalent.  I would argue the very nature of wide distribution of
    online mapping will lead to an accelerated pace of cartographic upgrades.  \r\n\r\nThe
    web as a distribution platform for cartography combined with other data visualization
    contexts will give rise to a new visual grammars where the influences of folks
    like Tufte and Stephen Few will be mixing with recent work of Cindy Brewer, et
    al.\r\n\r\nIn short, GISers are defensive enough about embracing the future, let's
    immediately grant them the false nostalgia of a past golden era of Robinson-inspired
    cartography.\r\n\r\nBrian Timoney"

  content: "@brian - I gather you didn't actually check out my presentation. :)\n\nThis
    was exactly the argument I made. That \"loss of cartography\" is a common criticism,
    but it is self-reflective (e.g. using bad defaults in ArcMap) and also being well
    addressed in the fast feedback loop of web mapping. Mapnik, EveryBlock, CloudMade,
    GeoCommons are just a very few of the projects and companies working on providing
    better cartographic tools and designs. \n\nWhat is important is for the traditional,
    professional cartographers to actually respect and learn from the interaction
    and usability design that is evolving around geospatial tools on the web and incorporate
    these into their own domains and tools."

  content: "I don't believe that Neogeography is going to water down formal GIS at
    all, and I think the presentation does an excellent job at showing how the two
    approaches are different, but share a similar goal.\r\n\r\nGeography and Interface
    Design both involve a good amount of social science, and I think it's good to
    keep that in mind when designing these systems.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed that
    while Neogeographical data can rarely be used in a formal GIS, formal GIS data
    can be applied to Neogeographical systems.  So maybe this can help increase the
    marketability of formal GIS data."

  content: While I agree that cartography is not quite 'lost' (pun intended), I don't
    believe we have GIS to thank for it.  I don't think there's a single GIS package
    out there that packs the necessary graphic cojones to produce exceptional cartographic
    work.  There's a lot of great cartographic work being done out there, and while
    much of it has its genesis in GIS, it needs post-processing in one of the graphic
    powerhouses to push it into the realm of good cartography.

  content: "@Terry - indeed this was part of the presentation. ArcGIS produces terrible
    looking maps. Most modern cartographers I've talked with may use it to start,
    but then quickly move to InDesign to do the real styling and design for their
    maps."

<p>My presentation at the NCGIS 2009 conference was "Lessons Learned from Neogeography Applied to GIS". Obviously a very interesting topic, given the continual discussion around the term "neogeography" as well as standards, web tools, and open data. Sean and I spent a good bit of time exchanging viewpoints and ideas so that I could get a better idea of where GIS users are coming from and their common criticisms of the neogeography domain.</p>
<p>What we realized was that these criticisms are reflections that GIS itself is facing: </p>
<ul>
<li>lack of metadata,</li>
<li>amateurs doing analysis, and</li>
<li>the loss of cartography</li><br />
</ul><br />
However because web maps are more public and involve feedback mechanism such as comments or blog posts, then they are much more visible and loudly critiqued.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is value in considering where this public discourse has more quickly evolved solutions and examples that GIS can incorporate. For example, standard user experience design around forms and input requests as well as feedback and user reward for supplying metadata. Sites like Yelp! make use of quite onerous metadata such as open hours, cuisine type, average cost - that the user is willingly supplying because it provides utility. They can then search, filter, and share this information.</p>
<p>Beyond the common criticisms, I identified three primary areas that neogeography is going beyond traditional GIS focus. Usability, Interoperability, and Participation are all aspects that GIS has struggled with, and in fact any inwardly focused domain has difficulty achieving. By incorporating innovative and external solutions that have emerged, GIS has the ability to take advantage and excel in applying these lessons to achieving their own needs.</p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=LessonslearnedfromNeogeographyNCGIS2009-090223130937-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=lessons-learned-from-neogeography-nc-gis-2009" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=LessonslearnedfromNeogeographyNCGIS2009-090223130937-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=lessons-learned-from-neogeography-nc-gis-2009" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355" /><br />

<p>I believe the presentation was well received, and definitely touched upon many points raised in other presentations both in recognizing the positive aspects of innovative GIS applications as well as common problems that are faced exposing complex data and capabilities to citizens. I'm definitely interested in any additional feedback or thoughts. I'll be speaking and discussing in several panels at the American Association of Geographers meeting in Las Vegas next month - a group with similar criticisms and potential points of collaboration.<br /></p>
