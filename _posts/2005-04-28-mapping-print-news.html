<p>You can now view a map of the United States with the locations of various "front pages" of newspapers. <a href='http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/flash/'>Today's Front Pages Map</a> (via <a href='http://radio.weblogs.com/0100875/2005/01/12.html#a1133'>BrainOff</a>) More interfaces like this is great for providing information in a geographic medium. Say, I want to see what's going on in the 4 corners of Florida. So without having to refer to a map, then google for each of those towns, dig through the ads and other links to finally find a newspaper. Now you can just click the four corners!</p>
