<p>Today is Friday the 13th, my coworker brought a black cat into work (he had to go to the vet - the cat, not the coworker - the coworker's problems can't be fixed) which has crossed my path *several* times, and there is the first thunderstorm of the year occuring.</p>
<p>Methinks I should avoid any unduly dangerous acts today...</p>
<p>Actually, I'm heading into the <a href='http://www.dia.org'>DIA</a> for their <a href='http://www.dia.org/calendar/friday_nights/'>Friday's at the DIA</a>. They have a <a href='http://www.dia.org/calendar/today_at_the_dia/item.asp?webitemid=297'>Beyond Big: Oversized Prints, Drawings and Photographs</a> exhibition I want to see, and there will be music to enjoy. </p>
<p>I hope no paintings try to kill me.</p>
