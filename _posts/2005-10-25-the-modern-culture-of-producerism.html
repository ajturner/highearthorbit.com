  content: I agree that we should use our technology to share and reflect.  When we're
    busy observing, we miss the subjective experience.  I think some become obsessed
    with "writing" their our own little history.

<p>Modern pessimists will say we've become a society of <a href='en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism'>consumerism</a> . Rising middle-class, dropping prices on basic goods, Wal-mart, large houses, suburbia. </p>
<p>The internet put inexpensive (relatively) publishing tools in the hands of the average public. However, the average public published a </p>

<p>and then went about their business <a href='http://riaa.com'>stealing from babies</a>, collecting and collating their audio collections, downloading video.</p>
<p>Now, however, we are truly moving into an era of producerism. Take <em>exhibit A</em>, the current products of the recent, much lauded "Evening at the Adler". Count them, 1 podcast several dozen pictures, and no less than 6 blogs by the <em>panel</em> let alone any number of the participants.</p>

<p>Each trip I take finds me swarmed by people snapping their pictures, taking video shots, and writing their self-published weblogs. People are infatuated with <em>creating</em> and capturing media and sharing it via Flickr, SmugMug, Snapfish, GoogleVideo, iTMS, Podcasts, VidCasts, mash-ups, RSS.</p>
<p>This all makes me very excited. People are sharing ideas, information, their lives and experiences. I can share, 'mix', consume, redistribute, and learn. </p>
<p>But what does concern me is people enjoying where they are, and what they have. Don't live life <em>through</em> your video camera/blog, use it as a medium to share and reflect.</p>
