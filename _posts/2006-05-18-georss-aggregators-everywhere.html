<p>There are many <a href='http://georss.org'>GeoRSS</a> aggregators showing up. It's a balancing game - you need feeds and data to build the tools, but why produce the data if no tools to consume them? But it appears with the large rise in geo-location awareness, and "neography" (for lack of a better term), there is sufficient enthusiasm behind putting geographic meta-data inside of feeds and sites, which is great.</p>
<p>So far I've seen the following aggregators pop-up with GeoRSS support. These are being covered in the <a href='http://georss.org/blog'>GeoRSS blog</a> - so you can get more specific information, as well as useful feeds, from there.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://mapufacture.com'>Mapufacture</a> - personal maps with bounded locations & feeds</li>
<li><a href='http://placedb.org'>PlaceDB</a> - large listing of aggregated feeds, where the user can produce localized feeds. It also geolocates news items by looking for location names, cities, and regions.</li>
<li><a href='http://fofredux.sf.net'>FoFRedux</a> - general feed aggregator which supports parsing & aggregating GeoRSS feeds</li><br />
</ul></p>
