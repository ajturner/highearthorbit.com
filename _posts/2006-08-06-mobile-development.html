  content: "Perhaps when PDAs (and eventually phones with developer-accessible WiFi)
    start using WiFi location to do all sorts of cool and lucrative things, the carriers
    will suddenly see the light.\r\n"

  content: "Good point Allan - Wifi geolocation, along with VoIP could subvert mobile
    carriers. They can either catch up, or be left behind. \r\n\r\nI've started seeing
    more mobiles with Wifi. Combined with the possibility of broader range WiMax would
    be a very good solution\r\n"

<p>Mobile applications are teetering on the edge of what will be Web 3.0. Web2.0 showed us that web-applications can be as full-featured as their desktop counter-parts with the added benefit that we don't have to download and maintain the application and also carry our data between various computers.</p>
<p>Previous mobile applications were relegated to simple applications, or Brew/J2ME applications that were carrier specific, limited in use, and non-upgradeable. By contrast, full featured mobile web browsers like <a href='http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/' title='Opera Mobile Product page'>Opera Mobile</a> provide a common base to deploy applications via web interfaces. This could be compared to the effect a standards based, open-browser like <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/' title='Mozilla Firefox Homepage'>Firefox</a> spawned Web2.0. Give users a single, stable application, and developers a common framework in which to deploy the UI for applications, and things will happen.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.digital-web.com/articles/getting_mobile/' title='Digital Web Magazine: Getting Mobile'>This article on Getting Mobile</a>, by Brian Fling of <a href='http://blueflavor.com/' title='BlueFlavor homepage'>BlueFlavor</a> is a good introduction to some of the current hurdles in developing a mobile application or site. </p>
<p>What is particularly scary is the control mobile carriers have in North America. This was definitely illustrated for the niche geo-market at Where2.0, where US mobile operators refuse to open the <a href='http://gsmloc.org' title='GSMLoc project'>location-interface for mobile phones</a> (except Nextel, and limited Nokia phones).</p>
<p>However, I think this is the same powerplay that Microsoft was pulling in the '90s. Standards and open-platforms will emerge that will enable developers and companies to provide various tools and utilities to users on the go.  </p>
