  content: Thanks for the mention, Andrew. Just wanted to clarify that I didn't do
    all of the location pieces in Drupal - much of that was written by Ankur Rishi
    of Civic Space Labs - but am keen to extend this as an API to do some other cool
    stuff. Shame I missed your talk at FOSS4G, I would have really liked to have seen
    it.

<p><a href="http://www.dankarran.com" title="Dan Karran">Dan Karran</a> has been working on making a <a href="http://geodan.org/" title="GeoDan">Geospatial Content Management System (GeoCMS)</a> using Drupal and using the existing <a href="http://drupal.org/project/location" title="Drupal Location Module">location modules</a> which adds location information to any node. Additionally, he's written <a href="http://drupal.org/project/georss" title="Drupal GeoRSS Module">GeoRSS</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/kml" title="Drupal KML Module">KML modules</a>, that allow for consuming and publishing these geospatial feeds. In Drupal, everything is a node. So when consuming feeds, new nodes can be created for locations that are consumed. Then information, links to other nodes, and various other metadata can be associated to this node, and it is then aggregated back out for other services to consume, display, and reaggregate.</p>
<p>This work is a perfect example of the point of my talk at FOSS4G, <a href="http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=189&amp;sessionId=46&amp;confId=1" title="FOSS4G: Enabling Users to Produce Personalized Geodata" rel="me">Enabling Users to Produce Personalized Geodata</a>. It's more important for developers to add geographic capabilities to existing, and widely used tools than to make geo-specific tools and expect users to come and use them. People are already using Drupal for their content, and now they can easily add location data and share it with their users and consume feeds.</p>
