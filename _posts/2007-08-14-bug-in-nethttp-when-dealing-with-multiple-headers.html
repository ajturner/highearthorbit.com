  content: that's no good, man.  you always gotta double-check all that stuff.  otherwise,
    you're liable to find yourself trapped in a closet like r. kelly.  and you know
    what that means.

<p>I just discovered a bug in Ruby's open-uri library, caused by the Net::HTTP library, or at best really annoying behavior that <em>will break</em> when you try and use it. The problem lies in dealing with an HTTP request that returns multiple values for a field. <a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=12775&amp;group_id=1306&amp;atid=5145" title="RubyForge: Multiple x-forwarded-for header fields">This forum topic discusses</a> that having multiple instances of a field is valid in HTTP1.1 (RFC2616). </p>
<p>So when you use Net::HTTP to fetch a document like this, it will create an array for every field, holding each value found for the field. That's great. However, in open-uri#last_modified then gets this array and joins the values together to get a single string. </p>
<p>The example I ran into is the <em>Last-Modified</em> field. Given HTTP headers like this:</p>
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br />
Server: Undisclosed-Webserver/0.1<br />
Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2007 15:03:29 GMT<br />
Last-modified: Tue, 14 Aug 2007 15:03:29 GMT<br />
Content-type: application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml<br />
Last-modified: Wed, 08 Aug 2007 18:34:55 GMT<br />
Connection: close<br />
</pre></p>
<p>And then calling <code>response.each_header {|f,v| puts "#{f}: #{v}"}</code> will result in <code>Last-Modified: "Tue, 14 Aug 2007 15:21:22 GMT, Wed, 08 Aug 2007 18:34:55 GMT"</code>. Go ahead and try throwing <code>Time.httpdate</code> at that. You'll get <code>ArgumentError: not RFC 2616 compliant date:</code>. </p>
<p>To simply recreate this bug, try the following ruby code:</p>
<pre>
require 'open-uri'<br />
res = open("http://popsci.com/popsci/kml/popsci_future_environment.kml")<br />
res.last_modified<br />
</pre></p>
<p>A simple solution, or workaround, is to just get the hash and deal with it yourself: <code>response.to_hash.each {|f,v| puts "#{f}: #{v}"} # => last-modified: "Tue, 14 Aug 2007 15:21:22 GMT</code> </p>
<p>I'm not going to mention any names on this particular offending party that was silly to include 2 Last-Modified dates, but <a href="http://www.popsci.com/" title="Popular Science">you know who you are</a>. </p>
