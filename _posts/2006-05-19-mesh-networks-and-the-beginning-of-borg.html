  content: "This isn't just another post about that Audrey thing of yours, right?
    \r\n\r\nHere in NoVA, the county government embraced Zipcar and Flexcar by providing
    spaces at Metro stations and 'strongly recommending' their inclusion in site plans
    for new development. They make sense here because there's a supportable density,
    alternative routes, and a technically literate population. I think they are a
    great system, but then I also own 2.5 cars...\r\n\r\nElsewhere... not so sure.
    \r\n\r\nWhich goes toward these other uses -- what level of interaction is required?
    what population can use this? how does this improve my life? Sure I live in a
    high traffic area, but when traffic jams are both predictable and difficult to
    avoid (there are only six bridge crossings of the Potomac from Alexandria to Great
    Falls), the benefits are harder to see. \r\n\r\nNow if the Porpoise (RIP) had
    a system where they would prepare a beer as I approached the bar, that would be
    worth buying.\r\n\r\nThe larger point is that technologists (or programmers) should
    think about how we live/work/travel and how their system can integrate
    or extend an existing practice or gesture without requiring us to learn something
    completely new.  I'm a fan of answering 'why?' rather than 'why not?' in these
    cases.\r\n\r\nFavorite example is  EZ-Pass. Brilliant, convenient, easily explained.
    Deducts the toll price via car-mounted RFID (or something similar) at speed. Automatically
    deducts from an account or credit card, requires a single non-interactive piece
    of hardware and no user interaction after installation. Order, Velcro to your
    windshield and be done. \r\n\r\nWhich makes this announcement interesting.\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/"

    got the courage to go ahead and give you a shout out from  Houston Texas! Just
    wanted to mention keep up the good job!

<p>Last night I got to attend a talk given by Robin Chase, Founder and Former CEO of Zipcar. Her talk was titled "Sustainable Transportation and Accessibility Research & Transformation", where she discussed how to decrease the impact of transportation on the environment and also using new transportation paradigms (such as shared car ownership) as a vehicle for bringing out mesh networks.</p>
<p>Mesh networks are simple: everything is a sensor and can connect to other sensors. She referred to it as "Ad Hoc Wireless networking", but I think that confuses the issue, because then people start thinking it just means WiFi everywhere.</p>
<p>What it really means is that all of these sensors and network devices can talk to one another, gather, share, and use information. For example, if every car was a member of the mesh network, they would all share traffic information, road conditions, and driver destination, perhaps. Then your in-dash display would update real-time traffic ahead of you as each of these cars shared their data. Also, you may be able to get internet down the line as you all shared a common network system.</p>
<p>Other examples that have popped up in the past include <a href=http://www.urban-atmospheres.net/Jabberwocky/'>finding potential</a> <a href='http://berkeley.intel-research.net/paulos/research/familiarstranger/'>mates/friends around you</a> by a profile you broadcast, or <a href='http://dailywireless.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1317'>tracking birds with RFID</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, now that you have all this data, how do you share it? Robin says she envisions all of this being built on open-source technologies, to allow for "innovation" (aka 'good hacking'). Open standards like <a href='http://georss.org'>GeoRSS</a> could also be used to begin disseminating all of this data as it streams in and share it between devices. See the <a href='http://strange.corante.com/archives/2006/05/19/xtech_2006_mikel_maron_georss.php'>notes on Mikel's XTech talk</a> for more inspiration along those lines.</p>
<p>If the devices are cheap (< $100), open-design, and run on open-software, this is a great future. If, however, it is run by proprietary, expensive technology, and closed standards, then you'll have a future where you get fast connections in your Ford car from other Ford cars, but no connection to all those BMW's or Toyotas on the road. </p>
