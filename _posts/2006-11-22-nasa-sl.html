  content: "Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\nYes, details are light but I imagine there
    are a lot of factors involved.  For example, they may be making changes to the
    code that they do not want to share. A hint of that is with the quantum/Newton
    physics issues, among other things. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is mainly for a prototype
    to show someone else... so a lot of things are expected to be done around the
    core."

<p>I'm a big fan of the acronyms NASA and SL and was really interested to read the article on <a href="http://www.knowprose.com/node/16725">NASA's SecondLife Presentation</a> of their work on Synthetic Worlds. (via <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/22/1454247">Slashdot</a>)</p>
<p>The details are fairly light, but it seems as though NASA is building a VR game on space exploration (remember <a href="http://www.planetmic.com/orbit/spasim01.htm">Microsoft's Space Simulator</a>, or the free and open-source <a href="http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/orbit.html">Orbiter</a>?). I wonder why NASA is rebuilding their own engine rather then picking up and using existing simulators (like <a href="http://spacecraft.sf.net">Open-SESSAME</a>) on top of the Unreal graphics/physics engine. </p>
<p>I also wonder if, given their presentation venue in SL, if they are considering integration of their space simulator with SecondLife itself. Apparently right now it is possible in SL to have some sort of orbital platform. But imagine if they actually opened up Space Stations, or other planets/moons for exploration/colonization. </p>
