  content: "Hi Andrew! Nice work you're doing with this plugin.\r\n\r\nAlso, although
    Wordpress doesn't provide an integrated solution to do updates I found PlugInstaller
    (<a href=\"http://henning.imaginemore.de/pluginstaller/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://henning.imaginemore.de/pluginstaller/</a>)
    to be very helpful in managing all things related to plugins. There is still hope
    such features will be included in the official releases sometimes."

  content: "Hi Andrew,\r\nthank you for this great plugin.\r\n\r\nI noticed a problem
    when a map was added to a post in wordpress. So everythink works fine and the
    map is shown correctly. But as soon as a comment is submitted to the post, the
    map disappears.\r\n\r\nAfter manually adding it again, it is shown until the next
    comment will be submitted.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it's the plugin or wordpress
    itself. Do you have any idea how to fix this?\r\n\r\n- Blog where plugin is used
    http://julia.mapled.de (its german).\r\n- Wordpress 2.3.3\r\n- Geopress
    2.4.1 using Google Maps\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhilipp"

    removes the map, and seems to eliminate the geo data in the post altogether -
    trying to re-add the data as above has no effect\r\n\r\nperhaps there is a conflict
    in the SQL tables or somesuch ?\r\n\r\nmy site here - http://www.samrohn.com/\r\n\r\nmany

  content: "Hey Andrew, \r\n\r\nGeoPress is just the plugin I've been looking for,
    it's great!\r\n\r\nI notice in the post above you give the PHP code for displaying
    a map of all posts for a category. I want to use this function display posts for
    different trips I have been on traveling.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I list a category
    page it only shows those posts that come up in that page (ie the last 10) and
    the archive page before that shows the previous ten to the first lot. I have my
    settings set to 'display map on single post' pages, is this the cause of the problem
    as hinted at above?\r\n\r\nIs there a way instead I could change my settings not
    to display a map in single posts as default and then hard code the map into my
    single post template? And then get all the posts to show up on the main index/archive
    page for the specific category (I sort my trips into different categories).\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndy"

  content: "Hi Andy - you're correct that the snippet I put in there does what you
    describe - shows the posts on a page.\r\n\r\nHowever, someone recently sent me
    an patch that handles all locations within a category and even draws a line between
    each of the locations (perfect for a trip). I've started integrating this in and
    it should be in the next release."

  content: "Hey Andrew, \r\n\r\nMe again, I just wondered whether there was a function
    I could specify in my template to over-ride the default zoom level, so that I
    can have two different zoomed maps. (One for a list view, and the other for the
    full post).\r\n\r\nI've tried playing with the geopress_map() function, but I'm
    not a coder and its all a bit out of my depth!\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nAndy"

    on my blog.\r\nThe problem is that the edit_post hook is also called when a comment
    is posted. Following the easy instructions on http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2007/01/28/authorization-and-intentionorigination-verification-when-using-the-edit_post-hook/

Some very nice users have sent in bug reports and I've been working through these and update the v2.4beta to 2.4.1 today. You should be getting it from the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geopress/" title="WordPress &#8250; GeoPress &laquo; WordPress Plugins">WordPress Plugin repository</a>. This way you get notified when new versions are available. If only WordPress had a simple mechanism for upgrading plugins without requiring downloading zip files and shell/FTP access. </p>
<p>Please let me know if you run into any issues. There had been numerous bugs in the beta - and I think most of these have been ironed out. I also updated the KML to use KML 2.2 and some simple atom links to your blog and post authors. </p>
<p>Also, the <code>geopress_map</code> function has some nice functionality for being embeddeable in Archive, Category, and Search pages. Right now the function signature is a little long, but if you want to have all your markers for a category or search show up in the map, you use the following in your template (assuming you want your map to be (200px high, 400px wide)</p>
<p><code><br />
<?php echo geopress_map(200, 400, -1, true, true); ?><br />
</code></p>
<p>This will embed the map with unlimited (-1) locations from the category (unless you have lots of geo-posts in a single view). Check out <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/category/conference/" title="High Earth Orbit   &raquo; Conference">my conference</a> blog post archive. </p>
<p>There have been numerous requests for per-item and categorical styling. This shouldn't be too hard to add. And also per-post zoom and map types. Also I will be updated GeoPress/MovableType to converge on the same feature-set. </p>
<p>Also - if you have any updates/patches/suggestions for GeoPress - chime in (and contribute code :)</p>
