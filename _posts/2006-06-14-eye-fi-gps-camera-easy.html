<p><a href="http://www.eye.fi/" title="Eye-Fi homepage">Eye-Fi</a> produces a card, Eye-Film, that is an SD card that can geolocate photos taken on it. This is an incredibly smart and easy way to add location to photos and still use any camera you choose. It does this by measuring the Wifi signals in the area and talking to <a href="http://loki.com" title="Loki homepage">Loki</a> (no, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki" title="Loki on Wikipedia">that one</a>) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not available until Fall 2006.</p>
