<p>We have an 'infestation of the nastiest kind'. Well, at least some spyware on various machines. However, the spyware programs, despite covering 30-some-thousand spyware types, still don't get it all. And even then, they report having found some 50-instances of various spyware. I think not.</p>
<p>Obviously spyware apps want to make you feel good about using that app, so therefore they can easily be subject to self-inflating their reports to make you think, "Ah, what a good piece of software, I want to send them my paycheck and the kids' college fund. What does Johnny & Suzie need to go to college for, now that their usage isn't being tracked by big green Ad-Men."</p>
<p>In a good report, Eric Howes did a <a href='http://spywarewarrior.com/asw-test-guide.htm'>Anti-Spyware Test (Guide)</a> that does a battery of tests against some 15 spyware apps. In the end? He suggests running several apps, since none of them are conclusive. </p>
<p>Another good resource is <a href='http://www.pcpitstop.com/spycheck/top25.asp'>PC Pitstop Top 25 Spyware and Adware</a>, which lists the top 25 'criminal cremenies'.</p>
<p>I doth say unto thee, I am glad I run a mac (though I doubt they're immune.)</p>
