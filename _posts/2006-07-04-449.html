<p>Check out the very simple and effective <a href='http://www.brail.org/transit/nyc.html' title='Interactive Transit Map of New York City, US'>interactive transit map of New York City</a>, you can also see <a href='http://www.brail.org/transit/london.html' title='Interactive Transit Map of London, England'>London</a> (via <a href='http://ccablog.blogspot.com/2006/07/interactive-subway-maps.html'>Cartography Blog</a>)</p>
<p>It's a great example of a <em>useful</em> mashup/data display (since he entered the data, and isn't really pulling it live from another source, it's not really a 'mashup' - but then again, what <strong>is</strong> a 'mashup'?) The data Greg used is available from his <a href='http://www.brail.org/transit/faq.html'>FAQ</a>.</p>
