<p><a href='http://blog.plazes.com/?p=116'>Plazes released</a> a <a href='http://beta.plazes.com/tools/mobile.php' title='Mobile Plazer'>Mobile Plazer</a>. They are using cell-tower geolocation, similar to <a href='http://gsmloc.com' title='GSMLoc project'>GSMLoc</a>. It will be interesting to see how they handle many locations belonging to a single Celltower location, as well as cell-towers being carrier specific. </p>
<p>They address the issue in their FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p>
After setting a Plaze the first time (e.g. by entering an address), it was necessary to enter an address again the next time I started the application at the same location. Why?</p>
<p>A newly discovered Plaze is bound to the GSM cell tower your mobile was connected to. The areas of cell towers overlap, so sometimes your mobile is connected to a different tower at the same location. Simply enter an address an set the Plaze a second time, then Plazes knows both cell towers and it will work better next time.<br />
</blockquote> </p>
<p>This is really cool. Geolocation by mobile without a GPS system is key to Location-Based technologies to take off and be generally accepted. Plazes is leading the edge of the community-based geolocated networks. Now time to build some services on top of their framework. </p>
