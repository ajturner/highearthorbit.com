  content: "I can concede you have a point where the use would impinge upon other
    formats - i.e. the feed - we had already discussed and rejected a use that would
    cause confusion as regards the KML icon.\r\n\r\nI think the analogy with Share
    this is fine - indeed we are also working on that, and the <a href=\"http://shareaholic.com/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Shareaholic</a> extension should soon sport the new generic
    share icon, also there are indications that iBegin's <a href=\"http://labs.ibegin.com/share/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Share WP plugin</a> will sport the new Open Share Icon in
    due course.\r\n\r\nThe use of an icon to signify the presence of \"geo\" information
    within a page -  it's use as an \"indicator\" within plugins and extensions such
    as the Minimap Sidebar - sits well with me. Another pertinent example is the iCab
    browser. Each of these examples may or may not well have \"child\" icons for individual
    functions, indeed iCab's developer has said as much, and why not? The universally
    accepted feed icon has found it's way to encompass both rss and atom and the Open
    Share icon is heading that way. (I take your reference to the very narrow opportunities
    for a Time and Titletag as I'm sure it was intended, tongue-in-cheek ;) )\r\n\r\nIt
    is early days in the life of both icons and this type of constructive criticism
    is most welcome, it can only help to hone an easily recognised web presence, representing
    a category of functions."

  content: "Thanks for sharing your thoughts Andrew. The guidelines are not set in
    stone and <em>should</em> evolve to represent the general opinion of the geotagging
    community.\r\n\r\nThis issue of an icon representing a concept vs specificity
    for one or more file formats is actually rather interesting. As you know the \"mission\"
    of the Geotag Icon is first and foremost to improve the current poor state of
    recognition of online geotagged content. To do this it has to be readily identifiable
    <em>and</em> format-agnostic; it deliberately does not attempt to differentiate
    KML from GeoRSS or GPX from geo on the basis of inter-operability, capability,
    or ultimate usage. It's there to establish a visual link between a set of geospatial
    coordinates and a document, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nMy own take, that the majority
    of users prefer format transparency is in fact reinforced by your own assertion
    here&mdash;namely that when confronted with a video you don't care what container
    format it's in; you just want to know that you can play it. Likewise, when presented
    with geotagged content&mdash;whether encoded by means of metadata, microformats,
    EXIF-GPS, etc&mdash;typical users just want to know that they can plot the position
    on a map. \r\n\r\nI accept that lumping together a bunch of XML derivates and
    other geodata syntaxes is artificial. As they currently stand the usage guidelines
    reflect a real-world compromise: we rub the purists the wrong way but at the same
    time by \"keeping it simple\" help make a much greater section of the online community
    aware of the concept and utility of geotagging. I happen to think that's a compromise
    worth making.\r\n\r\nIf there are further views concerning the breadth of the
    usage guidelines, and in particular suggestions for refining them in such a way
    as to accommodate all (OK, most) parties, I hope your readers will post them here
    or get in touch with the Project directly."

<p>There has been a meme floating around about the new "Geotag Icon" that was <a href="http://www.bioneural.net/2008/02/21/a-web-standard-icon-for-geotagging/" title="A web standard icon for geotagging at bioneural.net">originally proposed here</a> and now has an officious site: <a href="http://www.geotagicons.com" title="Home of the Geotag Icon Project">Geotag Icon Project</a></p>
<p>There has been a lot of dialog. <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/03/12/are-push-pins-inescapable/" title="Are Push Pins Inescapable? | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">Sean discusses</a> a lot of his thoughts about semantic interoperability and formats. There has also been a number of discussions on the design itself - everything from the color, to the pushpin being indicative of points only - maybe reinforcing the "red dot fever" that plagues many maps.</p>
<p>These are really minor quibbles. Overall I think it's a decent design that gives some simple meaning to what the icon conveys. However, the problem I do have is the <a href="http://www.geotagicons.com/usage-examples.html" title="Home of the Geotag Icon Project | Usage guidelines &amp; examples">Usage guidelines &amp; examples</a>. Essentially, they are saying it should be used for <strong>all</strong> geospatial formats.</p><br />
Example from the site:<br />

<p><a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2008/03/12/are-push-pins-inescapable/#comment-19347" title="Are Push Pins Inescapable? | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">Bruce defends this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Whereas the Geotag Icon describes a general concept (&acirc;&euro;This item is geotagged&acirc;&euro;) the KML icon and GeoRSS favicon each proclaim a file format. This is analogous to the Feed Icon: can you imagine having a different orange icon for each web feed format? There's no reason why the Geotag Icon can't sit side-by-side with file format icons if that's what folk wish to do. But a well-recognized Geotag Icon (in time!) adjacent to the text description 'Download KML file (opens in Google Earth)&acirc;&euro; could well be more informative to the majority users than what is otherwise sure to be a growing set of vaguely-related file format icons with which to become familiar. The power of de facto standard icons is in instant recognition&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;and the fewer the merrier!<br /><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I disagree, he's proposing this one icon should be used for a multitude of different formats that each have different capabilities and uses. It's not like the difference between RSS and Atom, it's the difference between HTML and RSS or CSS. Or a Video and a Photo. Sure, they're both images, but they're also very different in what they do.</p>
<p>He's creating additional confusion by using the Geotag icon for GeoRSS. GeoRSS isn't even a <em>file format</em>, it's an extension to another file format: RSS / Atom, and they already have a recognizable icon that has meaning to users. I wouldn't want to put yet another icon in front of them that meant something slightly different. And KML is a visualization format, similar to <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/a-proposal-georss-kml/" title="A Proposal - GeoRSS &amp; KML :: High Earth Orbit">HTML + CSS</a>. GPX is a very specific format that works for handheld GPS units and PND's. I'm surprised the Geotag Icon wasn't proposed to be used for Geo and Adr Microformats, since it matches this formula of all things geo.</p>
<p>This is the follie of the greater GIS community - assuming something is primarily <strong>geo</strong> first, and general information second. I'm surprised this is idea is also followed by people outside the GIS world.</p>
<p>So I only ask that the Usage guidelines of the Geotag icon be scaled back. It's interesting that it's been <a href="http://spatialviews.com/2008/03/08/geotag-icon/" title="spatialviews &Acirc;&raquo; Geotag Icon">incorporated into Minimap Sidebar</a> - good idea, but perhaps again confusing application with format? Using it in a photograph or video is nice because it's clear to me that the format is a video (and I don't care if it's mov, fla, et al.) and useful to be alerted that it has geocoded content inside. I also think it could be useful as a link to a page of Geospatial formats. Why not even use it like the <em>Share this on...</em> on the <a href="http://www.geotagicons.com/" title="Home of the Geotag Icon Project">Geotag project page</a> itself?<br /></p><center></p>

<p><em>GPX icon is from <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/products/communicator/" title="Garmin Communicator Plugin">Garmin's Communicator Plugin</a></em>. You could optionally replace the format names (like KML) with suggestion applications, but I find this a little to vendor specific. Don't you dislike it when people say things like "I opened the Internet Explorer page..."?</p>
<p>I think this set of links is how I would do it in <a href="http://georss.org/geopress" title="GeoPress | GeoRSS :: Geographically Encoded Objects for RSS feeds">GeoPress</a>. But don't suggest that Geotag Icon become the over-arching marker for other formats that happen to contain geo-data. Otherwise, I'll be suggesting a family of icons like <img src="http://highearthorbit.com/images/time_16.png" alt="Timetag Icon" style="float: none;padding: 0 2px 0 10px; margin: 0 0 -4px -10px" />Timetag, and <img src="http://highearthorbit.com/images/title_16.png" alt="Titletag Icon" style="float: none;padding: 0 2px 0 10px; margin: 0 0 -4px -10px" />Titletag.</p>
