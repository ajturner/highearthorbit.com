  content: "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nNicely done.  I'm the one that posted the news story
    for the green buildings on gs reddit.  Debated whether to use the state's original
    \"GIS\" label for their little mashup, but ultimately decided that although primitive,
    the mashup does likely tap into GIS data (though not dynamically).\r\n\r\nYou've
    brought up an interesting thought/question: 'A Google Map is not GIS.'\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious where you draw the line?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Google Maps is a basic
    representation of a GIS (data, software, hardware, network, standards, etc.).
    \ If a Google Maps mashup taps into a PostGIS db serving up KML via featureserver,
    is that GIS?  Or if someone sets up an ArcGIS 9.3 'Javascript API' site that mimics
    Google Maps, is that GIS?\r\n\r\nI could argue, though not definitively, that
    the map you made in 5 minutes is GIS, albeit at a basic/simple level.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for posting the link to Ars Technica...hadn't seen that.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAndres"

  content: "A GoogleMap, or Map in general, does not make something GIS. Is a Road
    Atlas \"GIS\"? It is a cartographic representation of geospatial data. \r\n\r\nAnd
    I assume for the CA Green Buildings that it's just placing markers from a database,
    this perhaps *starts* blurring the line towards GIS, but personally I think of
    GIS as having more analytic or precision information. \r\n\r\nAnd obviously this
    meaning changes over time as the technology becomes more commonly available. Interfacing
    with a network through a terminal used to be Information Technology, not it's
    just \"surfing the web\" :) Obviously there are aspects of IT (or GIS) utilized
    to generate the tools and data sources, but the actual simple display or utilization
    of these tools in a lightweight way seems like a very loose use of \"GIS\"."

  content: "I think the line is very blurry at present.  Although a Google Map (output)
    is not GIS, the Google Maps app (and API) running in the 'background' seem to
    me to be a GIS.  Same goes for a Road Atlas...it is the output of a GIS...\r\n\r\nSo
    I guess it depends on whether you include an \"a\" before GIS in those sentences.
    \ As in: a road atlas is not \"a\" GIS, but a road atlas is (part of) GIS (i.e.,
    a part of the whole).  A Google Map is not \"a\" GIS, but the Google Maps application/system/platform
    (whatever you want to call it) is GIS.\r\n\r\nBack to my original question: where
    does one draw the line?  Hmmm...I may need to ask the general question via a blog
    post.\r\n\r\nHow's that for semantics? :)  Anyway, good food for thought.\r\n\r\nHave
    a good one.\r\n\r\na/f"

  content: "It is a GIS, as are other mapping API's (application/system/platform).
    \ \r\n\r\nIf you look at most definitions of a GIS you could argue that mapping
    API's fulfill those requirements.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=define:+GIS\r\n\r\n...
    and on the analytical side, is a route calculation not \"analytical\"?  For instance,
    the Multimap API can do standard route, optimised multiple waypoint routes, and
    matrix routes (search by driving distance).  This is GIS analysis to me.\r\n\r\nIf
    Andrew extended his demo to allow routing between the buildings and allow users
    to add their own buildings or edit existing, then i think the argument would be
    even stronger."

  content: "I've often wondered about how to explain GIS vs Google Maps - as whilst
    I don't have a wealth of experience with either, as a project manager you sometimes
    get asked to justify the difference.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if wrong, but I didn't
    think Virtual Earth or Google Maps provided APIs to do any spatial queries (i.e.
    can you do a point-in-polygon query?)\r\n\r\nI tend to think of VE/GMaps as
    a presentation tool rather than a query engine (which is where a GIS comes into
    it's own).....\r\n\r\nTo elaborate - suppose one had three sets of spatial data
    \r\n\r\n1. stations/rail lines\r\n2. Main roads.\r\n3. Homes for sale.....\r\n\r\nNow
    I want to query this data to find \"all homes for sale, within 2mile of a rail
    station, but not on a main road and not having the railway line come within 1
    mi of the home\".....(now that's what I call advanced query for a property search!).\r\n\r\nVE/GMaps
    as far as I can tell don't provide for this kind of query, one would need something
    like MapInfo.  \r\n\r\nOf course I am happy to be corrected.....\r\n\r\nIf my
    understanding is correct, then perhaps the term GIS needs to be expanded.....\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    we could have GLAS (Geographic Location Analytic System, which just handles the
    spatial querying) and a GLPS (Geographic Location Presentation System, taking
    the result set as geocoded points and displaying against map)"

<p>I like taking data that is thrown up on a map in a completely ad-hoc format and <em>freeing</em> it into an actually usable format. In this case, I recently saw the new <a href="http://www.greenbuildings.dgs.ca.gov/" title="State of California's Green Building Directory">State of California's Green Building Directory</a> (via <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/geospatial" title="geospatial: geography + technology">geospatial reddit</a>).</p>
<p>What is particularly funny about this project is its use of the term "GIS Technologies" to describe a very archaic map with stand-up pins. A GoogleMap is not GIS. The original site does allow users to search by specific attributes, but not really in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>The map is created by directly building markers up in Javascript. Assumedly the back-end is powered by a database, and it would have been nice of them to share out an actual listing of the underlying data. This is a perfect example of the study <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080603-study-gov-websites-should-focus-on-rss-xmlnot-redesigns.html" title="Study: .gov web sites should focus on RSS, XML'&rdquo;not redesigns">.gov web sites should focus on RSS, XML'&rdquo;not redesigns</a>.</p>

<p>So instead I just created a KML version that uses Extended Data to call out the various attributes on the features such as <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=222" title="">LEED</a> rating and number of buildings. You can <a href="http://mapsomething.com/demo/greenbuildings/" title="California Green Buildings Database">see my own mashup</a> and grab the <a href="http://mapsomething.com/demo/greenbuildings/CAGreenBuildings.kml">KML file</a>.</p>
<p>As I said before, this map I made isn't "GIS". But consider I spent about 5 minutes with the original Javascript and a bunch of RegExps to create the KML. It's up to you to make something useful with it.</p>
