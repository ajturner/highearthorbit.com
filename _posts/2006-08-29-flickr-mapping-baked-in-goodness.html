<p>The idea of geotagging photos is not new. With the huge swell of interest around mapping when the GoogleMaps API came out, very quickly people starting mashing up <a href='http://panoramio.com' title='Panoramio' rel='met'>Flickr</a> & <a href='http://www.flickrmap.com/' title='FlickrMap'>Maps</a>. Flickr even hired Dan Catt of <a href='http://geobloggers.com'>GeoBloggers</a> quite awhile ago.</p>
<p><strike>Yahoo</strike>Flickr finally <a href='http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/great_shot_wher.html'>released their built-in mapping</a> tools. </p>
<p>Here's how their mapping works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to "Organize" your photos, and then select the "Map" tag</li>
<li>Answer the Privacy question - location privacy will become more of an issue with the rise of social location tracking, geotagging, etc.</li>
<li>Flickr sees if you have any existing geotagged photos and places them - it appears to just use photos that have been tagged with <code>geotagged</code> and not read the location information if it is embedded in the EXiF. Hopefully that is something that will change</li>
<li>Drag photos from the bottom well onto the map. Make sure to place the round button below the photo thumbnail. You can then add more photos to this <em>stack</em> of photos at a location. Also, place photos by the subject matter, not <em>where</em> you took the photo from. If I'm looking for the Eiffel tower photos, I don't want to see it placed down the Champs d'Elysee</li>
<li>Photos now have a "Map" link below them on the photos page. You can also explore photos near where your photos were taken - so very <em>social</em><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Overall it's a very good user experience. It's nice now that mapping is baked-right-into Flickr, which means quicker adoption rate, and easier to get going with your mapping (rather than being relegated to various mapping <a href='http://oregonstate.edu/~earlyj/gpsphotolinker/' title='Mac OSX GPS Photo Linker'>utilities</a> and <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/set-latitude-longitude-in-iview-media-pro/' title='' rel='me'>scripts</a>)</p>
<p>A couple of things I hope Flickr adds very soon:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href='http://georss.org' title='GeoRSS Homepage' rel='contact'>GeoRSS</a> output in the feeds</li>
<li>Add <a href='http://microformats.org/wiki/geo' title='Microformats Wiki: Geo'>Microformats:geo</a> to the photo descriptions</li>
<li>Markup the location description of each photo in <a href='http://microformats.org/wiki/adr' title='Microformats Wiki: Adr'>Microformats:adr</a> format.</li>
<li>Parse the Geo Exif tags in photos</li><br />
</ol></p>
