<p>Yahoo!, has an addition to their quickly growing Developer Network, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/" title="Yahoo Developer Center for Ruby">Yahoo Developer Network: Ruby Center</a>. (via <a href="http://rubyblog.de/index.php/2006/09/22/yahoo-eroffnet-ruby-developer-center/" title="RubyBlog.de"> RubyBlog.de</a>)</p>
<p>Yahoo has really impressed me with their change from "annoying portal with too many links" to "doing lots of cool stuff and telling people how to use it too". Their developer network is a great resource for both just learning about a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/python/" title="Yahoo Developer Network: Python Center">language</a>/<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" title="Yahoo User Interface library">tool</a>/<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/" title="Yahoo design patterns">design pattern</a>, as well as how to leverage really deep and useful Yahoo resources within your own application. </p>
<p>Providing these resources is definitely in their own interests, such as <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/ruby-cache.html" title="Yahoo Ruby: Caching">Cache Yahoo! Web Service Calls using Ruby</a>, but is also just a great service to the community. Their <a href="http://gallery.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo Gallery">Gallery</a> is also a good place for interesting sites and project ideas. </p>
