<p>A nice benefit of living in the SW Michigan Area of the big 'D-City' is the fact that there is one of the oldest, and in general superb, curling club.  However, if I didn't live in the area, I'd be in a pinch. </p>
<p>No longer, thanks to <a href='http://www.customicerinks.com/curling.asp'>Custom Curling Rinks</a> I can now have a " Portable Roll-Out-Rink Curling Pad and refrigeration system."</p>
