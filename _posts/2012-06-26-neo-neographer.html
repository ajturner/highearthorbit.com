<p>As a very outward facing technologist, I tend to be very open with a lot of my information on location, work, and thoughts. I do keep personal things very private, but sometimes there are things that I am too excited to not share.</p>
<p><a href="http://verdantconcepts.com/" title="VerdantConcepts" target="_new" rel="spouse">Corrie</a> and I are eagerly expecting our first child in the very near future. Being in DC we found it fitting that he is due on July 4, 2012. And fortunately for those who are familiar with DC summer weather the sooner the better to avoid the heat.</p>
<p>I have a number of projects in mind and will share details as they are relevant. In particular I'm investigating a few concepts of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Quantified-Self/events/67461842/" target="_new" title="Quantified Children meetup">"quantified children"</a>. And all the discussion of location privacy sharing depending on context will become much more personal.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to soon introducing you to our newest Neogeographer/Rocket Scientist/Environmental Engineer or whatever he wants to be.</p>
