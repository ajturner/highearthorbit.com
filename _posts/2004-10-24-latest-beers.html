<p>I heard an article on the <a href='http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/'>Splendid Table</a> today on my way to drop off a DVD at the library (why more people don't use the library as a free resource for videos, I don't understand), regarding the original concoction of the pilsner back in the ol' Czech Republic (well, *new* Czech Republic, but where it was... oh nevermind).</p>
<p>Anyways, still find it interesting the large lack of perspective of typical American beer drinkers. 'Yeah, I like both kinds of beer, Bud & Bud Lite'</p>
<p><img src='images/BeerLabels/TuppersHopPocket.jpg' align='right'>But I digress. The most recent, excellent, beer (besides my own ;) I have gotten to drink was the 'Tupper Hop Pocket' by <a href='http://www.olddominion.com/'>Old Dominion Ale Company</a> which gets an '88' at <a href='http://beeradvocate.com/beer/rate_results/3620/1191/'>Beer Advocate</a>. Got to enjoy this particular brew at Bailey's in Arlington whilst in the Washington, D.C. area for a wedding last weekend. I also had a 'Red Seal Ale', which I heartily un-recommend. Too smooth and bodiless for a red.</p>
