<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast'>Screencasts</a> are like geek pr0n - and great advertising. If you haven't seen a screencast, picture watching someone who is really good at programming showing you a neat trick. They are incredibly good an pulling together a lot of ideas and seeing how something is actually <em>done</em>, rather than a list of features of what is <em>can do</em>.</p>
<p>This is true for open-source languages and applications that are trying to attract developers and users. Especially since documentations is notoriously difficult to write well, and therefore very scarce. Making a screencast of you using your tool/language/etc. is easy and fun (for developers).</p>
<p>It's also a great <a href='http://www.elsua.net/2006/01/20/using-screencasts-to-augment-instruction/'>training tool</a> and can provide very good tool for teaching users, where they can later review and get a better idea of how to use a feature than a description like "open the 'File' menu, select the 'Go to...' item... yadda yadda".</p>
<p>They're relatively easy to make. There are packages for Mac OS X such as <a href='http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/'>Snapz Pro</a> and for Windows options like <a href='http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp'>Camtasia Studio</a> or the free <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx'>Windows media encoder</a>.</p>
