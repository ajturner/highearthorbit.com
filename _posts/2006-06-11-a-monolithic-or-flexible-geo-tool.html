  content: "With some development of modules and configuration, the <a href=\"http://drupal.org\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a> framework could suit the role of a personal geospatial
    manager / geospatial management suite quite well.\r\n\r\nUpload of GPX files
    could allow the system to extract tracks and waypoints and store those so they
    could be later queried: 'Which cities have I travelled to over past [time period]?',
    'Where did I go in those places?', etc. Uploading photos to the system could allow
    for geotagging based on time matching with that pre-existing GPX data. The data
    could optionally be shared with projects like OpenStreetMap which is always on
    the look out for more GPX tracks."

  content: "With your additions to consuming/producing GeoRSS I think you may
    be right. What I am asking for is  a CMS where the Content is usually location-based
    content. \r\n\r\nNow if only it was written in a language I liked working with.
    :)  Guess we sometimes have to make sacrifices to meet our desires."

<p>What I really need and want is a really flexible and useful "geo-tool" software application.</p>
<p>I have been gathering a lot of waypoints, tracks, location histories, notes, geo-photographs, etc. Yet when I want to put my location in a blog post, an email, a website, an article, or add metadata to a file, I have to dig through many programs, files, and then copy and paste. Perhaps even convert between DMS and DDMMSS.</p>
<p>This application should be enable me to store my waypoints and tracks. These would either be loaded from GPX files, hand entered, CSV files, drawn on a map, or geolocated by an street address. In addition, these tracks and waypoints could have time component.</p>
<p>I can then add notes or photographs to these locations and tracks, share these with friends, or easily search for things like "what photos have I taken in Southern Germany before 2004?", or "what's a good 3-5 mile hike I've done?"</p>
<p>Lastly, this tool would easily allow me to do local searches, enter the location latitude/longitude, address, or track information into text fields, as GeoRSS, XML, Microformat, or anything else. Place it directly on my clipboard for pasting, or pop-up a window with the information for me to edit, fill-in, then copy and paste. Or provide a Mac OS X service/hotkey that I would quickly enter this information into the current field in a program, or website.</p>
<p>Any other ideas on what this type of application should do or look-like? Is it a web-application? A <em>desktop</em> application would let me use it "in the field" where I may not have net access. So it could run a local-webserver if that were the case. But my data would have to be able to be private, though shareable is nice too. I could <em>bundle</em> up a track and photos/notes and send them to a friend or post them to a webpage.</p>
