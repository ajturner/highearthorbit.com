<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/STS-134_patch.png/201px-STS-134_patch.png" style="float:right; padding: 5px" alt="STS-134 Flight patch" />I was fortunate enough to be selected to attend the #NASATweetup to see the last launch of Space Shuttle Endeavor - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-134" target="_new">STS-134</a>. Along with 150 other lucky selected people including even @dens, the Obamas, Gabi Giffords, Seth Green, Levar Burton and numerous inspiring astronauts we'll be at the countdown clock with a front row seat the second to last launch of the entire shuttle program.</p>
<p>Endeavor is carrying the <a href="http://ams-02project.jsc.nasa.gov/" title="Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer" target="_new">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a> to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html" title="NASA - International Space Station" target="_new">International Space Station</a> that will perform some inspiring science on measuring dark matter radiation. There's also a host of spiders, aggressive bacteria and other science experiments that will be run on the iSS. I'll have more photos and stories up soon.</p>
