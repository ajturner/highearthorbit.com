<h3>Thoughts</h3><br />
I really enjoyed giving this talk. I hope the people who heard it, or check out the slides find it compelling to do their part to integrate into the GeoStack by working with common data standards and tools where possible. I think it was received very well overall - based on the amount of people that talked to me about it afterwards. I even got cited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dangermond" title="Jack Dangermond" rel="met">Jack Dangermond</a> of <a href="http://esri.com" title="ESRI homepage">ESRI</a> in his panel discussion. </p>
<h3>Upcoming</h3><br />
I'll be giving similar talks this summer at <a href="http://www.stateofthemap.org" title="State of the Map Conference homepage">State of the Map</a> and <a href="http://guadec.org/" title="The Gnome Conference homepage">GUADEC</a> in the UK with <a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/" title="Henri Bergius">Henri Bergius</a> and <a href="http://www.tigert.com/" title="tigert.com">Tuomas Kuosmanen</a>.</p>
