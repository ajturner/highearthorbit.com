  content: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nI was also on a trip and used my Nokia 6230 to connect
    to the internet via bluetooth. I can't say I had the same problems as you. I was
    able to use google to search and google maps  for locations. I don't have a gmail
    account so I didn't test that. Maybe there was another problem preventing you
    access?"

<p>When traveling (locally, or nationally), I have enjoyed the freedom of getting to the <em>Information Superhighway</em> via Bluetooth and my Nokia 6600. I get decent speed (i.e. can load and read most any webpage, reminiscent of perhaps a speedy land-line modem connection). </p>
<p>I am limited, however, by one major problem. Google apparently blocks my incoming (or returning?) GSM connection. While I can load almost any website, I am unable to access Google, GoogleMail, GoogleMaps, et. al. The reason behind such a move is... perplexing.</p>
<p>My connection will connect and have a short <em>chat</em> with Google, but the result is still a blank webpage (or <em>Loading...</em> in the case of GoogleMail). </p>
<p>My one recourse is Google's very cool <a href='http://www.google.com/xhtml'>Google WAP</a> site (which is oddly named XHTML, although the header reads:</p>
<p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0//EN" "http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/xhtml-mobile10.dtd"></p>
<p>I can access this tight, efficient search engine through the built-in browser on my phone or over the BT->GSM connection. Too bad there isn't a gmail.com/xhtml</p>
