  of soda & pizza (queue standard geek jokes here), and lots and lots of programming
  they closed the 20th Annual AdHoc/MacHack conference.

  content: "It's terrible to hear about your run of bad luck at MacHack/Adhoc.
    I was really hoping you'd be able to pull out the stops with some type of airship
    widget or iSight video degrader for dual-G5 users, but clearly it couldn't come
    together. May your newfound Newton curse remind you to never create anything useful.\r\n\r\nI
    promise none of your prospective in-laws really understand what this was about."

  content: "Hrm - a hack to make the isight quality the same (frame-rate, pixelating)
    regardless of the machine you're on. So a video chat on a Dual-G5 is the same
    low quality as on an iBook G3-600.\r\n\r\nIntriguing... well, if there is another
    incarnation of MacHack I'll have to pull that together.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts
    on an Airship widget? oooh, how about a widget that flies around. All the widgets
    currently don't move, but are static. "

  content: "Haven't yet downloaded the DashSaver, but you could always go After Dark
    on it, and start flying the widgets around. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, I think there
    is usually an announcement about which airships are covering which games, so you
    could add a google hack which would show the location of the event and floating
    jpg of the airship used. Perhaps combine with google earth (when is it coming?)
    to show 'what an airship might see' via a circular flight path over 'Your Name
    Here' Stadium."

<p>My first <a href='http://adhocconference.com'>Ad-Hoc/MacHack Conference</a> is now over. After 4 days and 4 nights of sessions, papers, hilarious talks, tons of soda & pizza (queue standard geek jokes here), and lots and lots of programming they closed the 20th Annual AdHoc/MacHack conference.</p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/AndyBuildingRobot.jpg'><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-AndyBuildingRobot.jpg' alt='Andy building a mac robot'  align='left' hspace='10px' vspace='10px'/></a>I got a little over involved in several hack (showcase) projects and so was actually programming <em>during</em> the presentations. That meant that I didn't actually get to see a bunch of the hack presentations, which was very sad. </p>
<p>I did, however, finish 2 hacks very successfully and helped several others on their projects.</p>
<h2>DashSaver</h2><br />
The first project was done by a challenge by <a href='http://andyi.com'>Andy Ihnatko</a> stating that when he first wrote a book on Tiger, he thought the dashboard was great. However, he wishes he could retract it because, in his opinion, it's a neat toy but not really useful. He would like to see the computer intelligently display information to users, even when they may not be actively using the computer - such as from across the room or at a glance.</p>
<p>Well, I responded by developing <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/dashsaver/DashSaver.dmg'>DashSaver</a> It is a Mac OS X screen saver that activates the dashboard and hides the desktop. It acts and works like a normal screensaver, and so doesn't require any additional underlying process or overhead on the computer. When you return to your computer, just wiggle the mouse and the desktop is available and you are at the dashboard. I chose to lave the user at the dashboard so they could 'click' on items that appeared on the dashboard.</p>
<p>I developed this early Friday morning and used it on the my iBook and G5 for the rest of the day and found it incredibly useful. When I wasn't using my computer, or came back to it after being gone, the dashboard had useful information like weather, news, mail, stocks, and whatever other widgets you find useful. I now <em>use</em> the dashboard rather than just <em>play</em> with it.</p>
<p>Well, the "jury" (<a href='http://andyi.com'>Andy Ihnatko</a> and <a href='http://foodisworse.typepad.com/this/'>Scott Kanaster</a> from Google) agreed and awarded me the Jury Prize for most useful hack (which is actually kind of a bad mark - the hacks weren't <em>supposed</em> to be useful). It netted me a very slick, but very inoperative (like my hack should have been) Newton pad. I've never had a Newton or even really seen one up close. But now I'm intrigued - it just fits so well in the hand.</p>
<h2>bTop Robot</h2><br />
<a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/bTopRobot2.jpg'><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-bTopRobot2.jpg' alt='bTopRobot' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' height='200px' align='right'/></a>The other project I worked on was developing a mobile robot with a MacMini onboard an iSight camera, and a new hardware interface board developed by <a href='http://perfsci.com'>Perfectly Scientific</a> that is targeted to the Apple platform. The robot could be either driven via a mouse from an wireless laptop (all over wifi) or it would <em>track</em> bright green objects. To demonstrate, we wrapped green tape around one of the devs legs and as he walked around the robot followed him. It worked out incredibly well (I was very suprised myself). This got us <del>2nd</del> 3rd prize overall in the public voting. </p>
<p>Overall it was a great conference. I had a ton of fun and met a bunch of people. I really want to go to more of these small, personable conferences where I can learn alot. I still stood out with my iBook, but only because everyone else had a powerbook. Mike Cohen has put up some <a href='http://macmegasite.com/ADHOC2005/ADHOC2005.html'>pictures of AdHoc 2005</a>.</p>
<p>But alas, due to falling attendance and expenses, it was announced that this had been the last AdHoc/MacHack. I sincerely hope that we can pull something else together as many people pointed out there was nothing else like this conference. I'll do whatever I can to help out. </p>
