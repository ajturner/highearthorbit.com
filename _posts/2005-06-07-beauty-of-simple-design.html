<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/WorldClock.jpg' alt='Moma World Clock' align='right' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' />I find this <a href='http://momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=27782&langId=-1'>MoMA World Clock</a> simply brilliant in design and effectiveness. Perhaps it's my many years of engineering education (heh - it's more like my many more years of video game playing), but looking at this one clock I can easily read the time in other cities by quickly performing the rotation to align the "12-o'clock" appropriately. </p>
<p>While their <a href='http://momastore.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=12819'>Barrel Clock</a> is neat too, the names of the side of the barrel make the single look, lots of info paradigm not work. </p>
