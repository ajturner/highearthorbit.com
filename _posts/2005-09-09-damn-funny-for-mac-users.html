<p>There's a very large, and good reasoned grumbling about Apple's <a href='http://sean.typepad.com/ditto/2005/09/schizo_interfac.html'>repeated bashing</a> of <a href='http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGHIDesign/chapter_4_section_2.html'>their own HIG</a> (Human Interface Guidelines). <a href='http://daringfireball.net'>Daring Fireball</a> has alleviated all of our pent up frustration as developers and users in a hilarious parody that reads like a true-to-life-made-for-TV script. <a href='http://daringfireball.net/2005/09/anthropomorphized'>The iTunes 5 Announcement From the Perspective of an Anthropomorphized Brushed Metal User Interface Theme</a></p>
<p>A short excerpt to whet your appetite and make sure you read the whole thing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong class="name">Brushed Metal:</strong> I told you something was fucked up when the new version of Mail didn&#8217;t go with me.</p>
<p><strong class="name">Mike:</strong> You&#8217;ve got a nice long-term deal with the Finder&#8230;</p>
<p><strong class="name">Brushed Metal:</strong> That two-timing piece of crap?</p>
<p><strong class="name">Mike:</strong> &#8230;iChat, Calculator&#8230;</p>
<p><strong class="name">Brushed Metal:</strong> Calculator? I&#8217;m out of iTunes and you tell me I&#8217;ve still got <em>Calculator</em>? When is the Special Event scheduled for the next version of Calculator? Oh, that&#8217;s right, there is none, because <em>no one gives a shit about Calculator.</em></p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>As a developer of Mac OS X applications, Windows apps, and various cross-platform and web-applications, User Interface consistency is a real bear. Apple's Interface Builder really helps alot by providing built-in guides and tools for meeting their <em>published</em> HIG, if not their <em>employed</em> HIG. However, using toolkits like <a href='http://wxwidgets.org'>WxWidgets</a> which targets many platforms, having an OS consistent interface is difficult.</p>
<p>However, no matter how difficult, interface is <a href='http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/NotJustUsability.html'>extremely important</a></p>
