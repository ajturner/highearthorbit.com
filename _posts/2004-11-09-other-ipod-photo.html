<p>After listening to the Engadget PodCast 10 by Phillip Torrone I was thinking of some other uses of the Photo iPod.</p>
<p>1) Upload presentation slides, on-the-road you only need to then jack your iPod into a projector or television and cycle through your slides. I heard that there is even a preview of the next slide on the ipod, essentially providing a cue to the speaker. </p>
<p>2) Mobile digital image viewer from camera cards. This will probably require either a 3rd party adapter for accepting memory cards or a firewire output from the camera</p>
<p>3) Downloading &#38; viewing moblog feeds and photo-blog feeds as well as 'podcast' feeds.</p>
<p>Now if only Apple would open it's API. </p>
