<p>Still alive and busily mapping New Zealand. I have 6 days of tracks to sort through and upload - and already 416 photos. Tomorrow we head across Cook Strait to the South Island.</p>
<p>I tried last minute to setup a meet-up of New Zealand mappers such as <a href="http://www.projectxtech.com">ProjectX Technologies</a> and <a href="http://www.trippermap.com/">TripperMap</a> <a href="http://www.allthegoodness.com/">Mark Zeman</a> - but I was late and it's high-holiday-traveling season here, so we had to drink on our own. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/340439056/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/165/340439056_0fecb38025.jpg" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" alt="Tongarigo - 174" /></a></p>
<p>I have to say, there still isn't a good tool for dealing with all the GPS and Photo data and information. GPSPhotoLinker doesn't currently handle Pentax RAW files, and I frequently have to jump to Parallels Windows to use Garmin's manager for getting and dealing with maps. </p>
<p>Along the way I've been drawing up ideas and plans for a piece, or interconnected pieces of software that would simplify this process both on the trip and for dealing with when you get back from a trip. Something that handles a mixture of travel planning, updating/downloading en-route, and then cleaning up and publishing from afterwards. </p>
