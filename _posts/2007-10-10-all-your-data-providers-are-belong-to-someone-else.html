  content: "[...] Taking a look at trends in GIS 2.0 (or &#8216;Where 2.0,&#8217;
    it&#8217;s all semantics to me) it appears that the public (consumers) can contribute
    to both authoring and synthesizing of information through collective efforts that
    are individual (e.g., geotagging photos on Flickr), community-driven (e.g., OpenStreetMap)
    or commercially subsidized (i.e., crowdsourcing). As a result, the flow of information
    is multi-directional (or simply put: stuff is flying everywhere). BTW, Andrew
    Turner has a great post relevant to this topic. [...]"

<p>Things have started settling down over the recent quick succession of the largest navigation data providers being purchased. The <a href="http://www.blinkgeo.com/2007/10/trying-to-make-sense-of-the-navteq-acquisition-by-nokia-me-too/" title="BlinkGeo    &raquo; Trying to Make Sense of the Navteq Acquisition by Nokia?  Me too&#8230;">common question</a> that <a href="http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/3424-Jones-Google-Didnt-Pursue-NAVTEQ.html" title="Jones: Google Didn't Pursue NAVTEQ - All Points Blog">has been asked</a> is "Why didn't Google buy NAVTEQ?"</p>
<p>The answer seems simple enough - Google wouldn't want to be saddled with NAVTEQ's customers and history and infrastructure. It's not just about the data, NAVTEQ was a business in and of it's own right. Nokia buying NAVTEQ means they now have a direct line to sell both data and electronics devices to these customers. Not something Google would be interested in. But how does Google deal with <a href="http://think.random-stuff.org/FrontPage/archive/2007/10/08/belated-nokia-navteq-google-etc-thoughts" title="think.random-stuff &mdash; Belated Nokia Navteq Google etc thoughts">increased pricing or even lock-out</a> from data providers in the future? </p>
<p>What people are really asking is "Why didn't Google buy a data company?" But they have. At least, they're investing in data. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/google_uses_cro.html" title="Google Uses Crowdsourcing To Create Maps In India">Google is 'crowdsourcing' in India</a> (though seems more like 'outsourcing' with a prettier moniker). They're also <a href="http://blogs.business2.com/utilitybelt/2007/08/google-to-pay-u.html" title="The Utility Belt: Google to pay users for filling in Maps">paying users everywhere to map businesses</a>. This gets Google what they want in the end -- data. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=543" title="edparsons.com  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; The dust settles on NOKTEQ">Ed Parsons</a> says it fairly plainly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
what will be interesting in the future will be the relative contribution made by 'Cloud&acirc;&euro;¬ù collected data<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://openstreetmap.com/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> providers 100%, free, verified coverage in the Netherlands. Imagine that, there is now little to no reason to buy raw data in the Netherlands anymore. Value now comes from building great services on top of that data. Now carry forward a year or two when OSM has coverage of the other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Google/Yahoo/Microsoft win - they have all the data they want and can then bundle this into their web services, mobile devices, etc. without having to track usages, licenses, or derivative works. Everyone wins. </p>
<p>And Google has demonstrated excellent ability in <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=9a331eff-ae47-4609-b7cf-3452a742c64a&amp;k=55008" title="Story | The Vancouver Sun">working with governments</a> and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/blogs/node/3404" title="Google&#039;s Book Scan program a sign of the times - Computerworld Blogs">institutions</a> to free their data. Look at <a href="http://www.google.com/transit" title="Google Transit">Google Transit</a>. </p>
<p>My only concern is their past history in leveraging this data out of the institution but keeping it privately inside Google - only released under approved TOS and API's. Hopefully in the future they'll release this data - at least in it's original form - back to the public.</p>
<p>And there still is a market for <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=543" title="edparsons.com  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; The dust settles on NOKTEQ">NOKTEQ</a> or Tele/Tomlas - or even newcomers like <a href="http://www.cloudmade.com/" title="Cloud Made - Consultancy and Services for Open Data">CloudMade</a> that will take all this free and available data, package it, verify it, and deliver it to customers that value things like <abbr title="Service Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>'s. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">revolution like this happened before</a>. There were <a href="http://www.openz.org/oshistory.php?umsSession=fd2a4b51c9de7a9e8c545292a4a9b15f" title="Openz: A brief history of Open Source">skeptics</a>, and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tiemans.html" title="Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution">winners</a> - yet few doubters remain. The same will happen with open-data.</p>
