<p>After living two years in the SouthEast Michigan area, I really don't feel like I've taken as much advantage of the area as I should have. Luckily, visitors really wanted to go to the <a href='http://detroitsymphony.com'>Detroit Symphony Orchestra</a>, so I got a good excuse to go. </p>
<p>There was an excellent violinist, who at 24-years old owns and plays on a 300-year old Stradivarius. How does one get a piece of musical equipment ~ 275-years older than they are?</p>
<p>The DSO has a number of interesting concerts coming up as well: <a href='http://www.detroitsymphony.com/season/production.aspx?id=227'>Music from Final Fantasy</a> in July, and the music of Star Wars next January. </p>
