  content: "Why don't you use the HTML code:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWith
    the following CSS:\r\n\r\n.image {\r\n        padding: 0 3em;\r\n        margin:
    0 auto;\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.image img {\r\n        margin:
    0 auto;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.image p {\r\n        clear: both;\r\n        font-style:
    italic;\r\n        text-align: left;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis works in IE, Mozilla/Firefox,
    and Opera and validates. The caption will remain centered with respect to the
    image. The only problem that you may have would be that the width of the caption
    can be greater than the image's width, but that is easily solved."

  content: "The problem with that solution is that the image will \"float\" within
    it's parent div to remain centered above the text. I need the image to remain
    fixed to the page, and have the text float beneath it. Using margin: 0 auto; is
    definitely the solution if you don't mind the image moving.\r\n\r\n<a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/CSSTest2.html'

  content: "Sorry to reply to such an old thread, but I really need something similar.
    I had a site designed with text beneath three images, spread horizontally across
    the page. In attempting a small tweak, I butchered the code and an trying hard
    to get it back to normal. I have the images back to normal, but can't get the
    text to align beneath each image.\r\nIf anyone could post the proper coding for
    this, it would be GREATLY appreciated, as I'm already way behind schedule w/this
    project.\r\n\r\nI would use the above code, but I don't know where the text should
    go. Also, the way the site is set up I must input a correct \"div class\" before
    entering the image name. So I'd need to know where this goes as well. \r\nThank
    you in advance!"

<p>This is probably odd to most people, but for a project I had to put a caption below an image on a webpage. But I wanted the image to be fixed in position and the caption would automatically flow and remain centered no matter how long the string was. I knew the size of the image (original div) but not the text string.</p>
<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/CSSCaption.jpg' alt='CSS Caption' align='right' hspace='10px' vspace='10px'/>The trick lies in embedding the caption div within another div. Then the outer div should have a <code>left:</code> equal to half the image (or other div)'s width. The relevant CSS is:</p>
<pre><code><br />
outercaption {<br />
	position: relative;<br />
	left: 13px;<br />
	}<br />
.caption {<br />
	text-align: center;<br />
	position: relative;<br />
	left: -50%;<br />
	white-space: nowrap;<br />
	}<br />
</code></pre></p>
<p>Which will work with this HTML code. </p>
<pre><code></p>
<div class="outer">
<div class="imagecontainer">
<div class="image"></div></p>
<div class="outercaption">
<div id="replaceCaption" class="caption">Short</div><br />
		</div><br />
	</div><br />
</div><br />
</code></pre></p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/CSSTest.html'>Here is an example</a>. You can even put in your own text to see how it is dynamically sized. </p>
