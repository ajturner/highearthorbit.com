  content: "you might be a neogeographer if you asked @ajturner a question about how
    to do something and he said \"hm, that's an interesting question\".\r\n\r\nyou
    might be a neogeographer if you took \"map library\" and \"library 2.0\" and smashed
    them together and got something interesting.\r\n\r\nyou might be a neogeographer
    if you have some way of visualizing \"like flickr, but for maps!\" or \"like twitter,
    but for maps!\" or \"like linkedin, but with maps!\" (that last one I could really
    use)."

  content: "One might point out that some of what is going on under the umbrella of
    \"neogeography\" - particularly as per your definition of \r\n\r\n\"geographical
    techniques and tools used for personal activities or for utilization by a non-expert
    group of users; not formal or analytical\" \r\n\r\nis in fact being done by folks
    who spend their days and nights coding and cracking technical issues, as opposed
    to the complete neophyte - the Joe Public who's touched nary a shapefile nor a
    line of code before in his life.  \r\n\r\nIs there somewhere that \"neoGeo\" as
    empowerment of the non-geographers, non-coders and folks who don't have access
    to \"real\" GIS ala ArcGIS, et cetera ends;\r\n\r\n...in turn blending into where
    \"Geography 2.0\" begins, forming the realm of OS, mixed-discipline professionals,
    coders and other similar efforts;\r\n\r\n...which in turn also ends and blends
    into \"paleoGeo\" of the tradition desktop ArcGIS and similar users?\r\n\r\nDoesn't
    it all at some point become a continuous spectrum?"

  content: "Tyler -\r\n\r\nA bit of context regarding my Neogeography response. From
    a NeoGeo perspective, there is the potential for harm due to the fact that geo
    content and applications can be deployed and used with minimal  consideration
    or knowledge of the underlying and fundamental principals of geodesy, cartography,
    and/or geography.  When combined with the lack of statements concerning quality,
    accuracy, whether the data are fit for purpose and so forth there is the real
    potential for misuse of a neogeo applications. Sure, if one is deploying an application
    showing favorite bike routes there is really no issue. However, if such applicatons
    percolate into mission critical applications, such as emergency services, where
    there are real human (legal) consequences . . .  This is the area of my concern.
    If NeoGeo applications are not properly positioned and used,  such misuse could
    hurt the reputation of the geospatial industry. I am not opposed to NeoGeo. As
    a matter of fact, NeoGeo is providing a great service in engaging a much broader
    community of geo developers and users.  But I also think we need to insure that
    such applications are properly positioned, advertized, and used."

  content: "@dshorter - because it's not \"beginner geography\", it's actually a different
    application space, methodology, and toolset.\r\n\r\n@Carl - this is a similar
    argument that Media and News are facing - bloggers, video bloggers, photographers
    given the same power as professionals. There are definitely potential pitfalls
    or negative consequences, but the benefits of tremendous. The responsibility lies
    with the tool developer and advocates to properly impart the wisdom necessary
    for the tools. However, this won't guarantee proper usage - but relying on obscurity
    and difficulty to be barriers to use isn't a satisfactory solution."

(<a href="http://fantomplanet.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/the-medium-that-is-gis-is-changing/" title="The Medium That Is GIS Is Changing &laquo; FANTOM PLANET">more</a> <a href="http://ambergis.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/neogeographers-volunteers-and-crowds/" title="Neogeographers, Volunteers and Crowds &laquo; The Memory Leak">posts</a>). It's apparent that, given the quick and large-scale response to the original impetus, that this question has been brewing in the minds of many geo-types.</p>
<p>There are many analogies to draw here - and typical to the geoworld they see their situation as newly evolved, yet the same thing has happened in other, less specialist realms for much longer. Look at journalism vs. blogging, movies vs. television, or any number of other field that has had its identity questioned. My feelings are that GIS and Neogeography are in fact different things - but that doesn't mean they are mutually exclusive. </p>
<p>They have different goals and purposes. Their tools may often overlap, or even be the same in many cases, but probably with much different use cases. As technology advances in a field, and becomes more wide spread, easy to use, and powerful, then tools show up in the general market that enable a broader range of users that don't have the same experience and values as the original audience. This happened when supercomputers came to your pocket so you could figure out the right tip at dinner or check sports scores. I doubt that's what Turing had in mind, but that doesn't make the purpose less important. </p>
<h3>An Analogy Extended</h3><br />
A couple of weeks ago I gave a <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/gisday-2007-at-university-of-kansas-neogeography-and-gis/" title="High Earth Orbit  &raquo; Blog Archive   &raquo; GISDay 2007 at University of Kansas - Neogeography and GIS">presentation at the University of Kansas</a> on just this topic (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/gisday2007-neogeography-and-gis" title="GISDay2007 -  Neogeography And Gis &raquo; SlideShare">slides</a>). One parallel I drew was the concept of potentially emerging field of "Neoeconomics". You're an average consumer, planning your family budget. You probably don't buy <a href="http://www.storm.ca/~sdamus/gem30.htm" title="General Equilibrium Modeling - Gemodel 3.2">GEMODEL 3.2</a> to figure out how much you can spend on travel. Instead, you pull up a spreadsheet program like Excel and pound away entering numbers. You use the right tool for your job. </p>
<p>However, extend that a little further, what <strong>if</strong> economists could in fact aggregate everyone's private budget together and use this information to forecast purchasing trends, GDP and inflation? They would know expected money flow from the general populace. And now, what if, Economists could syndicate that information back down to everyone to utilized in correcting their budgets based on real expectations. There would be a better estimate of your salary, raise, cost of goods, and general economy. Things you care about for you and your family. </p>
<p>This is what is happening in the geospatial community right now. Neogeographers are creating tools and data for their use and goals, and mashing them up and doing all sorts of new (and <a href="http://www.festivalofmaps.com/index.aspx" title="Festival of Maps Chicago">not so new</a>) activites with these powerful tools. GIS experts are then utilizing these data and tools for analysis, coordination, and decision support. See the power of a mixture of tools like Google MyMaps, Twitter, Flickr, and MODIS satellite data (one of these things isn't like the others) when put together by a <a href="http://crschmidt.net/" title="Christopher Schmidt: GIS and Web Hacker &Acirc;&raquo; crschmidt.net">GIS expert</a> for disaster response in the <a href="http://hypercube.telascience.org/fire/" title="San Diego Wildfires 2007">San Diego Fires</a>. Neogeographers, public, and GIS experts working together smoothly. It almost makes me giddy.</p>
<p>So it's not REST, or GoogleEarth, or any data format, single tool, company, or title that makes something GIS or Neogeography. But that gets back to the question, "What is Neogeography"?</p>
<h3>The Definition</h3><br />
In doing research for the GISDay 2007 presentation, I looked at the etymology of other terms with <em><a href="http://www.answers.com/neoclassical&amp;r=67" title="neoclassicism">neo-</a></em> prefix and similar terms like <em><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/colloquial" title="colloquial - Definitions from Dictionary.com">colloquial</a></em>. Also, in my experience writing the book, giving talks, writing geo-tools, consulting, advising, assisting, chatting, and mapping - and most importantly as part of a complete career shift for me from my previous work, I spent a lot of time pondering the concept of <em>Neogeography</em>. </p>
<p>Based on my above thoughts, it has a kinship with the concept of "GIS" but also has different purposes and goals. So it is necessary to demarcate itself from GIS. To this end, I propose a definition. </p>
<style type="text/css" media="screen">
  .definition { margin: 5px; }<br />
  .definition .word { font-weight: bold; }<br />
  .definition .etymology {color: #888888; }<br />
  .definition .meaning { padding: 5px; }<br />
</style></p>
<div class="definition">
<span class="word">neogeography</span> <span class="pronunciation">|n&Auml;&ldquo;'&Aring;-j&Auml;&ldquo;-&Aring;g'r&Eacute;&trade;-f&Auml;&ldquo;|</span></p>
<p><span class="meaning">geographical techniques and tools used for personal activities or for utilization by a non-expert group of users; not formal or analytical.</span></p>
<p><span class="etymology" style="color: #888888;">[Greek, from <em>neos</em>, new. and Latin <em>ge&Aring;graphia</em>, from Greek <em>ge&Aring;graphi&Auml;</em>]</span></p>
<p><strong>neogeographer</strong> ne'o&Acirc;&middot;ge&Acirc;&middot;og'ra&Acirc;&middot;pher <em>n.</em><br />
</div></p>
<p>At least it's a succint phrasing of a concept that we can all collectively discuss. And finally, for just a small illustration: If you're using <a href="http://www.tagzania.com/" title="Tagzania: tagging the planet">Tagzania</a> to measure biodiversity of the cuddle-fish, you're doing GIS - if you're using ArcGIS to make a map of your summer vacation, you're doing neogeography. </p>
<p><em>PS. lazyweb, make me a 'You might be a neogeographer if...' like game for this</em></p>
