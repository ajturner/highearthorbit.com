<p><a href='http://www.dataplace.org/'>Dataplace</a> is huge clearinghouse of demographics & mapping information gleaned from the <a href='http://www.census.gov/geo/www/maps/'>US Tiger Census</a>. For example, you can get the <a href='http://www.dataplace.org/area_overview/index.html?place=p26.9:2160&z=1'>census of any region/city</a>, including a slick use of <a href='http://sparkline.org/'>sparklines</a>, as well as <a href='http://www.dataplace.org/map/?cid=21729'>a map of the location demographics</a> spread. </p>
<p>An incredible feature is the ability to build up your own thematic maps by overlaying various layers of information at your own choosing. For example, you can build a map, of say, overlay the "Percentage Housing Units that are Overcrowded" with the "Aggregated Family Income".</p>
<p>Like any good project nowadays, they have a <a href='http://blog.dataplace.org/'>Dataplace developer's blog</a>.<br />
<a href='http://www.knowledgeplex.org/forums'>Dataplace forums</a>.</p>
