  content: "[...] I have been a traveling extensively over the last couple of weeks,
    so I am a bit behind in my entries. Last week I was at the Location Intelligence
    (LI) Conference and the Web 2.0 Expo. I met Andrew Turner, who gave the most lucid
    and informative talk on Neogeography that I have ever heard at Web 2.0 Expo. He
    and Mikel Maron gave a longer workshop on the subject at LI (missed that one,
    but I was at the Expo with the AWS crowd). One of our guys attended and said that
    it was excellent as well. [...]"

  content: "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nThanks for the write up, much appreciated. I was pretty
    jet lagged when I gave the talk and had only agreed to do it that afternoon. So
    it was all pretty scary ... forget igniting, I thought I was going to go down
    in flames.\r\n\r\nFun though. Good to see you again.\r\n\r\nI'm over for OSCON,
    so hopefully see you there."

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/paulhammond/461166328/" title="Paul Hammond's Flickr: Geek Conference Audience Shot #1"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/461166328_d1d8308197_m.jpg" alt="Andrew Turner & Mikel Maron hacking on something before Web2.0 Expo Ignite" align="right" hspace="5px"/></a>Finally back from a week of fun and adventure in the bay area attending Location Intelligence, Web2.0 Expo, American Association of Geographers (last minute addition to attend their geo-science fair) and meeting lots of great people.</p>
<p>A couple of highlights:<br />
<a href="http://biomapping.net/about.htm" title="Christian Nold" rel="met">Christian Nold</a> is doing cool stuff with <a href="http://biomapping.net/" title="Biomapping">BioMapping</a>, where you measure your happiness level and geolocate it using GPS. If you're in the Mission district, stop by Southern Exposure (no, it's not a strip club) to see his demos and try it out.</p>
<p>At Location Intelligence I got a chance to meet and play with the goodies of <a href="http://placebase.com">Placebase</a>, who provides commercial mapping support and datasets for large numbers of markers (where other mapping API's would choke). I also saw <a href="http://multimap.com">MultiMap</a>'s new slippy map and API and even <em>walking directions</em>, and map base-layers that match the local country's typical map display (think viewing online maps in the same format you're used to viewing your local paper maps). <a href="http://weogeo.com/" title="Weogeo">Weogeo</a> is making the eBay for maps. More on that after they release, but it's <strong>very</strong> cool, just check out their current front-page to get a flavor for what will be coming.</p>
<p>Web2.0 Expo was almost too huge to encompass. You can <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/web2expo" title="Technorati Blog Search: web2expo">read all about Web2.0 Expo here</a>. The first night had <a href="http://blog.web2expo.com/2007/04/ignite_expo_sch.html" title="Web2.0 Expo Ignite schedule">Ignite</a> talks - 15 slides/5 minutes, with great presentations from <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/canida" title="Instructables: Christy Canida">Christy Canida of Instructables</a> on 14-year-olds leading the charge on open-source hardware, <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/andre">Andre Charland</a> on the user-experience utility <a href="http://www.robotreplay.com/" title="Robot Replay">Robot Replay</a> (he still owes me a beer), and <a href="http://fotango.com/blog/" title="Fotango Blog" rel="met">Simon Wardley</a> from Fotango on Commodity Computing (actually 70 slides in 5 minutes, quite a feat). </p>
<p>I also got to see <a href="http://www.vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=1917" title="Thomas Vanderwal: Tagging that Works" rel="met">Thomas Vanderwal's talk on "Tagging That Works"</a>,<a href="http://blog.web2expo.com/2007/03/users_standing_.html"> Fred von Lohmann's "Licensing User-Generated Content"</a>, which was very interesting to hear a lawyer give you a lot of information, without specifically telling you what to do (since he's not <em>your</em> lawyer).</p>
<p>You should also check out <a href="http://swivel.com" title="Swivel">Swivel's relaunch of their preview</a> with all the data viewing/statistics goodness you can handle, and then some. </p>
<p>I met a lot more people, saw even more cool projects, and had far too many beers (all these companies just want to sponsor your alchoholism), but it was fun. Look for blog posts on specific companies and projects, particularly that pertain to geospatial applications. </p>
