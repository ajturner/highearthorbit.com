excerpt: "Taken from <a href=\"http://technocrat.net/article.pl?sid=04/08/11/0322211\">Technocrat.net</a>\r\n\r\nOne-handed
  keyboards sell for $99 to $350, but here's one that can be had for $25 at a well-known
  net merchant, and a little more at the CompUSA. Of course, it's intended for gamers,
  but can easily be made into a one-handed chording keyboard to nurture your inner
  cyborg, if you just design an appropriate keying pattern and learn it, and write
  a little software. This is just crying out for an Open Source project. You can help
  handicapped people, perhaps even influence a new generation of low-budget cyborgs!"

<p>The Belkin Nostromo n52 Speedpad has 14 typewriter-style keys that chord (meaning they can all be read individually), LEDs, a dial, and a game controller with firing button. That's easily enough to make a chording keyboard. You can use the game controller as four shift keys (your thumb rests upon it).</p>
<p>To make the job easier, here's C code to read the device on Linux. To finish the job, you'll also have to push key events back into the Linux console or X Windows. Code to do that is already available on the net, it's been written for use with other USB devices.<br />
