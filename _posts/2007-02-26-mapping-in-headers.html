<p><img id="image754" src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/michaeltyler_mapheader.png" alt="Michael Tyler - Map Header" style="width: 410px;" align="middle" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/>I finally have been catching up on my RSS feeds and saw that <a href="http://geobloggers.com">Dan Catt</a> pointed out this <a href="http://geobloggers.com/archives/2007/02/10/neat-google-maps-blog-header-integration/">nice example of a GoogleMap blog header</a>.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that the map has moved from the sidebar, or in post, to the <a href="http://www.defineblog.com/blog-strategies/google-adsense-location-location-location">most prominent space on the page</a>.<a href="http://michaeltyler.co.uk/">Michael</a> also did a very nice job with unique marker icons based on the post/image/tour. </p>
<p>This is a feature I'd like to add to <a href="http://georss.org/geopress">GeoPress</a>, pulling in and aggregating multiple GeoRSS streams, to mix-in with your blog posts. Currently, you can do this with Mapufacture, but it would be nice to build this all into GeoPress itself. </p>
