  content: What about having your web site powered by solar....AISO.Net (<a href="http://www.aiso.net"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.aiso.net</a>) is 100% solar powered, both
    their servers and data center are powered by onsite solar panels. And they also
    have a partnership with Co-Op America, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
    and the U.S. Green Building Council. Plus, they are doing more then just making
    sure their electricity is green. Their data center and office is green too by
    using environmentally friendly air conditioners, solar tubes to bring in natural
    light, a propane powered generator instead of diesel, VMWare virtualization to
    reduce their server electricity usage, 6 watt energy saving desktop computers
    for their employees, and soon to be LEED certified as a green data center, the
    only public one in North America, at least that I have found so far.

<p><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/aboutus-green-cert.thumbnail.gif" alt="Dreamhost Green Certification" align="right" hspace="5px"/>I've worked on a couple of environmental focused websites such as <a href="http://verdantconcepts.com" title="VerdantConcepts" rel="spouse">VerdantConcepts</a> and <a href="http://greenerearth.blogspot.com/" title="GreenerEarth Maps" rel="me">Greener Earth Maps</a>. A concern has always been the benefit/environmental cost ratio of running servers 24/7 that use up power and resources. This has been a <a href="http://www.secretlair.com/index.php?/clickableculture/entry/open_letter_to_the_second_life_environmental_council/" title="Open Letter to the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Second Life Environmental Council&acirc;&euro;&trade;">big issue</a> in persistant worlds such as <a href="http://earthdayinsecondlife.wikispaces.com/Environmental+Council" title="Second Life Environmental Council">Second Life</a> where every acre of digital world has a real-world cost due to maintaining the simulation, <em>even if no one is there!</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was a happy surprise when one of the hosting companies I use (such as this blog), <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2007/04/20/were-green/">Dreamhost, announced they are carbon neutral</a>. What this means is they've purchased certificates from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offset" title="Wikipedia: Carbon offset">carbon offset</a> provider. You can be carbon neutral by planting trees, using renewable energies, use carbon sequestration techniques, or the easy (yet effective) method of buying carbon offsets from an organization that will do this for you. </p>
<p>The internet, and computing usage, has a huge, and growing, impact on the environment. Companies create power stations just to power large internet companies and their hosting requirements. Therefore it is important to understand this impact and alleviate it through any of those means mentioned above. </p>
<p>In some ways, it is buying yourself the "Green" label, but in the end the effect is the same. You're putting your money where the need is, saving the environment. </p>
<p>So the question you should all be asking yourselves: "Is my hosting provider carbon neutral?" If not, make them, or move to one that is. </p>
