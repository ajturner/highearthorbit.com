  content: "There's a reason that the preamble to the Constitution seeks to ensure
    domestic tranquility. Ensure the domestic traniquility of your own household and
    buy a Tivo. Its easier to use and lets you muck about the XBox without inducing
    awkward discussions of the proper use of technology within a household. Its fine
    for you to fool around with your toys, but when it affects the shared toys of
    the household...\r\n\r\nI speak from experience here."

  content: "You speak of the SAF (Spouse/Significant Other Approval Factor). This
    is a very important factor. And I'm all about toys.\r\n\r\nHowever, when toys
    have a monthly fee I'm a little more dubious. I've seen the Elgato Home Media
    Viewer for discount around $80, but that doesn't deal w/ the recording aspect.\r\n\r\nNow,
    leaving personal alliances aside, is it worth it for the tech to purchase a toy
    they wouldn't use/want purely for the SAF of their other toys? Or should they
    leave the purchase of the S's desired toy for the S to acquire?"

  content: While I'm all for the tech purchasing shared toys, when considering the
    SAF, the tech must realize that publishing intended purchases on a blog does not
    count as seeking SA. There is no easy way to avoid the awkward discussions of
    proper use of technology.

  content: "So should I put you down for one Tivo or two?\r\n\r\nGo here http://pvrwire.com/
    to feel better about your impending purchase.\r\n\r\nWith prices as low as they
    are, the only question is subscription or lifetime payment?"

    my place to directly link to it. Sort of like the the \"Oh this is interesting\"
    when you're serving a search warrant, I suppose.\r\n\r\nBut now that you've found
    it, I can direct you to the very interesting open source project:\r\nhttp://centerstageproject.com/\r\n\r\nYou'll
    want to look at the various accessories to discover the missing link between the
    cable box and the imminently purchased Mac mini.\r\n\r\nJust don't look at the
    Nano while you're there because, well, there goes this week's paycheck.\r\n\r\n"

<p>About 2 years ago I hopped on the XBox modding train, installed a chip, a huge hard-drive, burned many a DVD and finally was able to watch <a href='http://mythtv.org'>MythTV</a> on my XBox. It's the only way we watch TV anymore, shuddering whenever the <a href='http://mythtv.org'>MythTV</a> fails us by either (a) filling up my harddrive with unused shows, or (b) crashing - which is usually some really odd occurence and after some googling, readily fixed. Since the XBox is our sole filter for incoming television transmission (well, beside the aforementioned missed shows, which require <a href='http://www.bittorrent.com/'>other means</a>) I have been cautious to mess with it too much. <em>Someone</em> will make me pay if they miss their <a href='www.thecharmedones.com/'>quality</a> <a href='http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/'>shows</a>.</p>
<p><a href='http://decafbad.com'>0xdecafbad</a> points out the modern efforts in <a href='http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/26/making-the-xbox-maker-friendly'>making the XBox Maker Friendly</a> Wow, I had no idea all this was going on. <a href='http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/'>XBMC</a> (XBox Media Center) now <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmcmythtv/'>supports MythTV</a>, bundles <a href='http://www.goahead.com/products/web_server.htm'>web server</a>, <a href='http://spyce.sourceforge.net/'>python scripting</a>, and there is a large <a href='http://www.xbmcscripts.com/'>repository of scripts</a>.</p>
<p>All this progress really makes me want to go back and start mucking with it again. Hrm - view my <a href='http://perceptiveautomation.com'>home automation</a> & home intranet from my XBox. I wonder if there is iCal file format support (ala <a href=''>ThunderBird</a>). Answer: <a href='http://xbmc-scripts.gueux.be/'>Yes, yes there is</a>.</p>
<p>Sounds very yummy.</p>
