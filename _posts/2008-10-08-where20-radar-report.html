<p>It's a little difficult to keep up with everything while I'm traveling. Pleasantly I noticed in my inbox that an announcement from O'Reilly went out that included my name.</p>
<p>Brady Forrest and I collaborated on producing a business-oriented analysis of the phenomenal growth around geospatial technology. The report, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596522568.do">Where2.0: The State of the Geospatial Web</a> covers various aspects of providers and potential opportunities in a variety of domains that are affected by the emergence of many factors. You can see an <a href="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/radar/research/Where2.0_excerpt.pdf" title="Where2.0 Report Excerpt">excerpt here</a></p>
<p>Some of these topics include: the impact of open and user-contributed geographic data on traditional data vendors and subsequent tools that rely on the availability, coverage, and quality of this data; highly-connected mobile devices, now often with developer available interfaces for location sharing and high-bandwidth internet connections; models for location-based advertising; and next generation applications such as games, augmented &amp; immersive reality; as well as many more.</p>
<p>It was definitely interesting writing the report from a more practical and business perspective. My background has been in pushing and developing new technologies. I found it eminently useful to think of it from a reverse perspective on evaluating the percolating usefulness across markets and uses. It is valuable for both business development as well as application development to connect.</p>
<p>In addition to the discussion and analysis of the current state of the geospatial web, the report includes a fairly broad directory of companies, applications, and organizations in Where2.0 across the multiple domains. It also includes in-depth profiles of some of the major players.</p>

It should also be useful for existing organizations that want to understand how the various technologies, acquisitions, and developments may affect their current market.</p>

<p>The report was originally written this Spring and originally announced at Where2.0. We've been continuously updating the report with new information such as the completion of the TeleAtlas/TomTom and NAVTEQ/Nokia mergers and the implications as well as the iPhone 3G with built-in GPS and Core Location API. The GeoWeb is a fast-moving space, so it's definitely difficult to attempt to grasp for a quick snapshot. We hope to update it more in the future as Where2.0 evolves.</p>
