<p>There was a bug in the <a href='projects/geolocation'>Geolocation Project Page</a> that prevented your location from being displayed if you didn't specify a new one. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>If you don't specify a location, then the 'geolocated ip' location will be output & the dot drawn.</p>
