<p><a href='http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax3d-the-next-arc-up-the-hype-curve' title='Ajaxian: AjaX3D">Ajaxian has an article discussing the press release and code for <a href='http://www.ajax3d.org/'>ajax3d.org</a>. Looking at the comments,  it's funny to see people disdain the return of 3D to the web. Following history, 3D web technology is following the standard <a href='http://www.gartner.com/pages/story.php.id.8795.s.8.jsp#2' title='Gartner Group: understanding hype cycles">"hype cycle"</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Technology Trigger"</li>
<li>"Peak of Inflated Expectations"</li>
<li>"Trough of Disillusionment"</li>
<li>"Slope of Enlightenment"</li>
<li>"Plateau of Productivity"</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Where 3D technology is now getting to the point of 'enlightenment', and finally to actually being productive. Bandwidth is high, machines are fast, people are using technology for ever-increasing amount of their activites. They want to explore, interact. Anyways, 3D still has a future - altered realities, virtual realities, physical-space interaction, etc. 3D technology will be pervading both industrial and residential lives.</p>
<p>As for the term 'AjaX3D', if you actually split it apart, it makes sense: "Asyncronous Javascript And X3D". An example may be flying through GoogleEarth and having 3D object downloaded as you approach the area, or interacting with 3D desktop on a website and having new objects come and go depending on data and your interactions.</p>
<p>VRML is definitely still alive - at <a href='http://simcreator.com' title='Realtime Technologies, Inc'>work</a> we use it for creating and driving in both generated and geo-specific worlds. Engineers use it for visualizing vehicle dynamics, human-machine interaction, and new city-scapes. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Media Machines isn't helping their case by using a demo, <a href='http://www.ajax3d.org/showcase/strikefighter/index.html' title='Strike Fighter v.3 Game'>Strike Fighter v.3 Game</a>, that causes flashback to the early '90s. And their plugin, <a href='http://www.mediamachines.com/download20beta.html'>Flux</a> is PC only (meaning Microsoft Windows). They say "for now", but the source uses DirectShow and ActiveX, two technologies that are most definitely <strong>not</strong> on any other platform.</p>
