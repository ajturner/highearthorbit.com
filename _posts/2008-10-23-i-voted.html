<p>...and so should you. And why not take a photo to capture your exercising democratic choice. Make sure to check out and add your "ivoted" photo to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ivoted/" title="Flickr: ivoted">Flickr ivoted group</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure where to go, I posted a dataset in KML (and CSV and Shapefile) to Finder! of <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/overlays/5541" title="Early Voting Locations in the US at GeoCommons Finder!">Early Voting Locations for the US</a> so you can find your nearest polling location.</p>
