  content: I received the "Kitchen Towel Exchange" in the mail today.  I think it
    has been altered since there are only 2 names on the list.  No way possible to
    receive 36 towels this way.  Can you give me the correct way this pyramid is to
    work.

  content: "Yes...it works.  Only 2 names are on the lists, but you are sending out
    6 letters to your friends, and their 6 friends will be the ones sending you the
    towels.  (6 X 6 = 36)\r\n\r\nJoy"

  content: I wanted to try the towel exchange but I don't understand how I will receive
    36 towels.  I can see getting six but not 36.

<p>So my girlfriend got, what I may consider, one of the funniest ideas that someone really takes as serious:</p>
<p><b>New Kitchen Towel Exchange</b></p>
<p>
This is a kitchen towel exchange. Please send a new Kitchen towel to the person whose name is listed below in #1 ... etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
This is NOT a chain letter. It's just for fun. You should receive 36 new towels for the price of one! It is fun to see the different locations from which your towels arrive! Seldom does anyone drop out because we all need new kitchen towels. Don't be the one responsible for spoiling the fun and stopping the parade of dishtowels!<br />
</p>
<p>So if anyone wants to send me a dishtowel...</p>
