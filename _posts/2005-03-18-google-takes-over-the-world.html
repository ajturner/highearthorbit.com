<p>While reading up on the 'infamous' GoogleX display, I saw this post at the google blog about <a href='http://code.google.com/'>Google:Code</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Code.google.com is our site for external developers interested in Google-related development. It's where we'll publish free source code and lists of our API services.</blockquote></p>
<p>Interestingly, the projects are being hosted at <a href='http://www.sf.net'>Sourceforge</a>. I would think that google could provide their own open-source server/utilities. But as the FAQ says, the devs like SF.</p>
<p>You can also check out the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis.html'>Google API</a> page. As I read in a recent interview with the <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> crew, creating & publishing your API does wonders to draw in hobbyists, free development and cool projects.</p>
