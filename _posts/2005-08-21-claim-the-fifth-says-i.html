<p><em>These are not the droids you're looking for. </em><br />
I did not <a href='http://www.uneasysilence.com/os-x-proven-hacked-and-running-on-an-ordinary-pc/'>read this</a>, nor use something like <a href='http://www.rajeevnet.com/hacks_hints/os_clone/os_cloning.html'>netcat and dd</a> in-place of a USB-Drive.</p>
<p>I will also say I know nothing about how smooth and fast it runs, though the NVidia graphics may or may not be recognized as a generic PCI card and therefore not support Quartz-Extreme. I would not say this because I do not know. </p>
<p><em>Nothing to see here, move along...</em></p>
<p>Also - lets be clear about this - I most definitely did <em>not</em> apply a <a href='http://osxonpc.com/'>SSE3->SSE2 patch</a> which would allow one to run PPC apps like iTunes with no problems. </p>
