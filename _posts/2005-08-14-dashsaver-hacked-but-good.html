<p><a href='http://www.padmacolors.org/archives/2005/08/05_113637.php'>PadmaColors</a> is a Japanese weblog that has figured out how to 'hack' <a href='http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/27558'>DashSaver</a>, my Dashboard as a screensaver app, to change the default background.</p>

<p>This is awesome. I'm impressed when people using hacking in such a good way. Of course, it may have been <em>easier</em> to ask me, since I am adding this feature in the next version. But I'm sure asking isn't nearly as much <em>fun</em>. :)</p>
<p>I'll make sure and let me them know when I release the next version. I imagine changing the preferences is a little easier then hex editing. What's also interesting is how much you can find out about how a program was written (function calls, data, etc.) from the hexEditor.</p>
<p>DashSaver is also mentioned on <a href='http://www003.upp.so-net.ne.jp/woodenships/05081/06/back50810806675.html'>WoodenShips</a>. </p>
