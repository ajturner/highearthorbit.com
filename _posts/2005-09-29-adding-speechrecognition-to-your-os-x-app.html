<p><a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/speech/'>Mac OS X</a> has long had (rumor has it in the dark days of pre-X) excellent speech recognition and speech output capability. There is no training involved, it just works. The OS supports it, many apps support it. It's great.</p>
<p>To enable speech, go to the <em>Speech</em> preference pane (you know the drill, <Cmd>-<Space>, <em>Spe</em>, <Enter>) and give it a drive. Great commands like "What time is it?", "Tell me a joke", or "switch to finder". Ok, so those aren't great. People really just think you're weird for shouting at your computer.</p>
<p>What I'm here to tell you to day, avid reader (yes singular, "Hi!") is that it is incredibly easy to add this capability to your own Cocoa applications.</p>
<p><a href='http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Speech/Articles/RecognizeSpeech.html'>Apple's Developer Docs: Speech</a> presents that basics, but leaves out a couple of <em>important</em> points.</p>
<p>1) Insert an <code>NSSpeechRecognizer</code> in your apps/class' interface definition (hint: it's the .h file)</p>
<pre>
<code><br />
	NSSpeechRecognizer* recog;<br />
</code><br />
</pre></p>
<p>2) Intialize the recognizer and specify the commands your app is looking for:</p>
<pre>
<code><br />
- (id)init {<br />
    self = [super init];<br />
    if (self) {<br />
        NSArray *cmds = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Forward",<br />
                @"Stop", @"Left", @"Right", @"Backwards", @"Roll over", nil];<br />
        recog = [[NSSpeechRecognizer alloc] init]; // recog is an ivar<br />
        [recog setCommands:cmds];<br />
        [recog setDelegate:self];<br />
    }<br />
    return self;<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
</pre></p>
<p>In this example I used the great commands, "Forward", "Stop", and "Roll over". ;)</p>
<p>3) Add the <code>speechRecognizer:</code> method which is what gets called by the system speech recognizer trying to figure out if your app knows what to do with the user's jabbering:</p>
<pre>
<code><br />
- (void)speechRecognizer:(NSSpeechRecognizer *)sender<br />
didRecognizeCommand:(id)aCmd {</p>
<p>	if ([(NSString *)aCmd isEqualToString:@"Forward"]) {<br />
		NSLog(@"Forward called");<br />
		   return;<br />
    }</p>
<p>    else if ([(NSString *)aCmd isEqualToString:@"Stop"]) {<br />
		NSLog(@"Stop called");<br />
        return;<br />
    }<br />
    else if ([(NSString *)aCmd isEqualToString:@"Roll over"]) {<br />
		NSLog(@"Rollover called");<br />
        // .... some response here...<br />
    }<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
</pre></p>
<p>4) Add startup and cleanup code:<br />
<em>awakeFromNib:</em></p>
<pre>
<code><br />
	[recog startListening];<br />
</code><br />
</pre></p>
<p><em>awakeFromNib:</em></p>
<pre>
<code><br />
	[recog dealloc];<br />
</code><br />
</pre></p>
<p>Now run your app, open the "Speech Command Window" and your app should be in there. Start speaking and your commands will get called (NSLog is a good debugger for this).</p>
