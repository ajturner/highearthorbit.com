  content: "Thanks, Andrew - was wondering how it went.\r\n\r\nI always like to create
    circles out of the seating at events to encourage more interaction - I hadn't
    thought about that in terms of panels. It'd be an interesting experiment. WhereCamp?

  content: "Andrew, Pamela led me here and it was very interesting to read how you
    prepared for and ran the panel - sounds like it went well.  \r\n\r\nOne thought
    about the arrangement of the chairs in a semi-circle is that the people on the
    end will have trouble seeing the audience, for the same reason as their not being
    able to see each other at a flat table.  \r\n\r\nI learnt a trick waaaaay back
    a long time ago when I was receiving training in how to deliver adult education
    - put the chairs and desks in a V formation (with the open end facing the audience).
    \ That provides the best visibility and eye contact for everyone, and there is
    an additional spooky thing that you can do as a facilitator: merely walk into
    the V if you want to pull up a conversation that's in progress.  It works!"

  content: "thanks for the tip David -\r\n\r\nPamela, panels at *camps are odd. The
    point of BarCamp sessions is already to have a discussion, not as much about hearing
    from a pre-designated panel of experts.\r\n\r\nHowever, we did do a panel on open
    government data at Gov20Camp, and it worked well in giving a focus to who was
    leading the conversation while still allowing others in the room to speak up and
    discuss.\r\n\r\nThe difficult part, as David points out, is layout to make the
    audience feel like they're able to see the interaction but while making the interaction
    primarily between the panelists and not *to* the audience.\r\n\r\nWhere's the
    book on \"Panel:ology\"?"

  content: "Hey thanks for a run-through on panel discussion. I have never been in
    a panel discussion, but I recently had my first experience in public speaking.
    I had to present on our venture to an auditorium full of university students.
    It went great, but I fumbled and did a lot of \"umm\", \"aa\", etc (as I don't
    have any prior training, formal or informal, on public speaking)!\r\n\r\nThere
    are good pointers in your post and so I will bookmark it, in case I'll need to
    moderate (or be part of) a panel someday.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your upcoming
    panels!"

While I feel very comfortable preparing and delivering a solo or duo presentation - this was my first panel, either as moderator or panelist.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3></p>
<p>I worked on synthesizing good and bad points from other panels I had experienced. They are often primarily mini-presentations rather than discussions. Our panel met up twice at SXSW before the actual session and each time was very relaxed with interesting discussion. So much so that I had to cut them off to save the "ah-ha" and "oh really?" moments for the actual panel itself.</p>
<p>In preparation, I had each of the panelists send me a bio, their thoughts on a couple of questions, and to gather links of example sites or tools that we could show off during the session. In addition, I prepared a series of talking points that I wanted to cover, various bullets on sub-points to cover, and an overall goal.</p>
<p>Outside of the panelists, other people submitted questions via Google Moderator and emails that helped provide different viewpoints.</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3></p>
<p>All of these preparations served very well, though I learned a few important points for future panelists: Prepare a clear, definitative first question. In spite of my well layed out series of bullet points, a short overview and introduction to the topic, the moment I turned to the panel to ask the first question it slipped out of my head.</p>
<p>Another lesson was that while having a good set of links prepared to show, it distracts from the conversation itself and turns into a small demo-fest. It would have been better to leave the links for people to discover on their own and focus on the discussion.</p>
<p>Other thoughts on how to run a good panel were logistics imposed by the conference itself. During our preparatory meetings, we would sit around a table, face one another, and it would be a very natural flow. Body language and eye contact has a tremendous impact on connecting with a speaker and allowing for a multiple-person discourse.</p>
<p>By contrast, panelists sit at a flat table, facing the audience, and have difficulty seeing one another. They either have to turn their body awkwardly to face other panelists, or look to the audience and not notice the panel.</p>
<p>For a better panel, like interviews, it seems better if there were chairs in a semi-circle and could easily see one another and naturally discuss. Wearing head or lapel mics would also create a more natural feel and better discusion.</p>
<p>During the panel, I monitored Twitter for "neocarto" and "neocartography". Most relevant messages were about attendees having difficulty finding the venue (it was located in the Hilton instead of the Convention Center) as well as waking up late (10AM on Sunday).</p>
<p>Another request that several panelists made was to encourage the audience to ask questions at any time during the panel. The first question didn't come until about 35 minutes, but once that bubble was broke - there were several others. It worked out fine, but retrospect, I would have <em>planted</em> a question with a friend to make sure and ask after about 20 minutes if no one else stepped up.</p>
<h3>Outcomes</h3></p>
<p>The 60 minutes went really quickly. We definitely didn't get to each of the topics I was hoping to, though we did address the primary issues and questions raised other good points. I'll follow up in another post about the specific points of the neocartography discussion.</p>
<p>I'm also at the American Association of Geographers next week on two panels - so it will be interesting to compare how those panels operate.</p>
