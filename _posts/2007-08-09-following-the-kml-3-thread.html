    the OGC OWS-5 KML 3 effort here on the Mapufacture blog. We&#8217;ll be implementing
    the proposed standards on Mapufacture and pushing the edge of the GeoWeb. These

    if you don&#8217;t want the nitty-gritty details of KML. If you need to catch

You can easily follow along or join the conversation using these very simple methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscribe to <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ogckml" title="del.icio.us bookmarks tagged 'ogckml'">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ogckml" title="technorati aggregated posts tagged 'ogckml'">technorati</a>, or your other aggregator of choice using the tag 'ogckml'</li>

<li>Tag your own blog posts or bookmarks to demos, stories, posts, or ideas using 'ogckml'</li>
<li>Join the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/kml" title="Join the #kml channel">#kml IRC channel on irc.freenode.net</a>. IRC - it's really cool (again)</li>
<li>Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geo-web-rest/" title="GeoWeb REST group">GeoWeb REST mailing list/group</a> for discussion on KML, and building a RESTful GeoWeb</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Also - I'll be moving my particular commentary over to the <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com" title="Mapufacture Blog">Mapufacture Blog</a>, since that's the company that I'm actually participating as a member of, and also where we'll be implementing the new specs. My next posts will discuss using KML to link to external services such as <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft_1" title="Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft 1 - OpenSearch">OpenSearch-Geo</a>, <a href="http://www.ogcnetwork.net/wfs" title="OGC Network: Web Feature Service">WFS</a>, <a href="http://www.ogcnetwork.net/wms" title="OGC Network: Web Mapping Service">WMS</a>, and more. </p>
