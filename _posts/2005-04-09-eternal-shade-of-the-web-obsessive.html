    early betas. The <a href=\"http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/geo/\"

<p>Argh, never happy with "how things are going" I always feel the need to upgrade/update/try the new thing. So I installed WordPress 1.5, which is "improved", but not so much for the trouble I'm going through to get things back to how they *were*. I mean, Pages ain't no static text. And there isn't decent "Geo" support anymore, so now I have to start digging around how to develop a plugin (I know I just saw a <a href='http://del.icio.us/nilspace'>link around here</a> someplace).</p>
<p>Top onto that I can't find a decent photoblog package (<a href='http://mindfulmusings.net/pictorialis/'>Pictorialis</a> is a bit too hodge-podgy for me). I want to just be able to upload images, have them display my exif data and some other text, and allow me to hack in some extra geo support. But alas, my search/attempts have been futile to date.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I got my own install of <a href='http://www.phprojekt.com/'>PHProjekt</a> (a fairly comprehensive project management package, along with a WAP viewable page, which is great from the ol' Nokia 6600), <a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'>Subversion (source-code versioning), </a><a href='http://www.edgewall.com/trac/'>Trac</a> (web-view and wiki for Subversion)</p>
