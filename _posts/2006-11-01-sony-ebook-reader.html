  content: "Sony? Gouging? Unmount that MemoryStick and say it ain't so!\r\n\r\nSony?
    Knows better than you? Take that anti-ATRAC attitude out of here!\r\n\r\nI think
    your SDK desire is what it will take for an ebook reader to truly reach market
    acceptance. Its the hobbyist/engineer/tinkerer market that will be required
    to work out the bugs and idiosyncrasies of the product and make it ready for prime
    time. As a gadget, you might get some early adopter traffic, but as a product
    to be enthusiastic about, you need some early adApter traffic.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking
    here of TiVo vs. ReplayTV. Both new, paradigm changing products, but IIRC, TiVo
    was more tolerant of the hackers. \r\n\r\nEbook readers have lots of potential,
    but I think it behooves  the creators to put the products out there and see how
    people use, alter, and improve them. \r\n\r\nBack in the day, most would have
    thought of this as basic customer research. \r\n\r\nSo, what would you change/add/delete?"

  content: "I definitely agree - appealing to the modders/hackers out there gets
    you press, free development, good ideas.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I want to see \"A
    Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\" (ala Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson) - learning,
    modifiable text devices\r\n\r\nSimple things I would change:\r\n* Add a jog dial,
    they are great for selection, page turning, etc.\r\n* Better button layout/design.
    Why a round button with just 2 positions, NorthEast & SouthWest?\r\n* Zoom 'out'
    one more level (higher resolution) to fit more text\r\n"

  content: "I have it.  I bought it.  The view is rotatable.  You can read like a
    book or turn the device and read lengthwise.  You can upload any PDF and you can
    upload any text after changing a WORD file into RTF format. (Rich Text Format).
    \ I have read several books on this device in the last month and love it.  It's
    far better on the eyes as you can change the font sizes.  The grayscale screen
    is easy on my eyes too.  \r\n\r\nI don' t think  this device is for anyone but
    an avid reader.  It does have a MP3 player and you can store photo's.  Both features...add
    in's to attract more people, but both features are features I overall have ignored.
    \r\n\r\nI can carry my college e-books (which printed out weigh about 15 lbs)
    and a novel and website content and blog content, etc.  in my purse.  The device
    weighs less than a makeup compact and you mentioend the add on accessories.  Both
    are unnecessary as the device comes with a hardsided leather case and an AC plug.
    \ I don't need a fancy plastic holder to hold the device upright.  Useless.  Also
    unnecessary to buy a cover when it comes with a much nicer one at no extra cost.\r\n\r\nThe
    nice aside..I can buy ebooks for far cheaper on Connect than I can anywhere else.
    I can also buy books sooner on Connect than I can on amazon.  It's instant book
    shopping.  \r\n\r\nI love the device and recommend it to anyone who is an avid
    reader and NO I do not work for Sony.....I just love to read and love having new
    choices for how I do so.  Also love having more room on my nightstand these days.
    \ No pile of crap falling over when I hit the snooze button in the morning either."

<p><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/ebook.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Sony eBook reader" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/>I got to see the new <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=PRS500U2" title="Sony eBook reader page">Sony ebook reader</a> at Borders. It's very nice - really readable, and a lot thinner than I expected. The pages actually <strong>look</strong> like real book pages. No aliasing, easy on the eyes. And even the background color of the screen looks like the medium-gray of a paperback book.</p>
<p>However, I don't think it will take off in the general public. For one, when you flip a page the wait is "long", 2-3 seconds, which is long for the average person when compared to flipping the page of a book, and more importantly the screen flashes black/white 2 or 3 times each page flip. I think early adopters like us may overlook that, most users will not.</p>
<p>Not to mention the price gouging on accessories. The Device itself is $350, then you have to pay $50 for the dock and $30 for a case - bringing it up to a possible $430 off the bat for the reader and cover.</p>
<p>The screen isn't touch sensitive, which is a little annoying, but not a deal breaker. I'd really like to be able to highlight and mark actual text. I used to do this on an iPaq with the Microsoft reader, which was also very crisp, and legible for reading books. Afterwards I could export a text file of all the passages I had highlighted. But size, cost, usability perhaps wasn't there for this first version of the eBook reader to have touch screen. You can mark a page, which makes a little 'dog ear' icon in the top-right corner of the page and then go back to view your marked pages from the book's table of contents.</p>
<p>The buttons are a little weird, there are 2 sets of "page" buttons. And the menu button is odd, diagonal push below a directional joystick. The joystick doesn't seem to serve that much purpose as most navigation is just up/down. There is also a row of number buttons below the screen, from 1 to 0 (yeah it's "computery" as they did 1-9, then 0. Why not just make it 10?). </p>
<p>Also, the view should be rotatable, but again, not a huge deal. </p>
<p>You can upload images, which are viewable in a grayscale, kind of pixelated/newspapery look. None of the demo books of text had embedded images, so I wonder how that works out. I've seen demo videos that show reading a page of text and having an embedded video (hrm, YouTube on your portable ebook reader)</p>
<p>What I'd *really* like to see, from a geek perspective, is an SDK for developing my own text/software so I can, say, make a dynamic map ;) </p>
<p>I like it, I may consider getting one, but will probably wait for v2.</p>
