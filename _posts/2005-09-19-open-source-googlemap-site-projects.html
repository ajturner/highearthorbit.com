<p><a href='http://mysociety.org'>MySociety</a> is a group that builds websites and web technologies meant for the community, and well, society. Their original/primary goal is developing community enhancing websites, such as political activism, and donations. They just launched two projects:</p>
<p><a href='http://www.mysociety.org/?p=82'>Placeopedia and YourHistoryHere</a>. <a href='http://www.placeopedia.com'>Placeopedia</a> geonnotates and maps <a href='http://wikipedia.org'>Wikipedia</a> entries, and <a href='http://www.yourhistoryhere.com/'>YourHistoryHere</a> allows members to create interesting and informative geolocated history tidbits and information. </p>
<p>Two shortcomings, Placeopedia currently requires users to specifically locate Wikipedia entries, rather than automatically obtaining this from the entry itself. I imagine this can easily change and be incorporated into the entry. The history seems currently limited to Britain. </p>
<p>Both are pretty neat projects, that are also open-sourced (find the <a href='https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/dir?d=mysociety'>CVS repository here</a>). They've also exposed the API for externally obtaining the data. <a href='http://www.placeopedia.com/cgi-bin/rss.cgi?topleft_long=-1;topleft_lat=54;bottomright_long=1;<br />
bottomright_lat=50'>http://www.placeopedia.com/cgi-bin/rss.cgi?topleft_long=-1;topleft_lat=54;<br />
bottomright_long=1;bottomright_lat=50</a> will generate an RSS feed of Wikipedia entries based on a geographic area. </p>
<p><a href='http://mysociety.org'>MySociety</a> has some other cool technologies and keeps a good blog of their developments they're working on. Another example is <a href=''>GAZE</a> which is an API to allow location searching:<br />
<a href='http://gaze.mysociety.org/gaze-rest?f=find_places&country=US&query=Northville'>http://gaze.mysociety.org/gaze-rest?f=find_places&country=US&query=Northville</a></p>
