Watch the <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location/'>travelog</a> for more exciting adventures - or if you just want to stalk. Or just grab the (apparently currently malformed, I'll fix that) <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location/rss.php'>travelog RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to get some time over the holidays to slick-up the interface for the travelog. Right now it's looking a little 'long in the tooth' due to updates in GoogleMaps, plethora of waypoints, and a wayward missing PHP script for updating locations. Gremlins in the machine I tells ya!</p>
