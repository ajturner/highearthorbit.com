  content: I love maps. I am drawn to them. If whatever I might be reading reveals
    a map as I turn the page, I will stop. I will look at it and study it. If it is
    a place I know or have been to, even better. But what really is most compelling
    to me are old maps. I love looking at how the world was perceived and recorded
    in the past. The older the better. How strange North America looked on an old
    map made by a European cartographer a few centuries ago. So if you know of any
    symposiums or lectures/presentations on historical maps, pass it along. Good
    stuff, and keep in touch!

  content: I go way back with a love of maps. I'm a sailor, a pilot and a "road warrior"
    in general. When I sailing or flying I always make sure to practice "old school"
    navigation at some point because electonics fail, but I'm pretty sure my eyesight
    and my brain will work (most days). This simple ritual has gotten me out of some
    tight spots that others, who may not have grown up with the "old fashioned" paper
    maps, parellel rules, etc., may have found challenging. Thanks for the reminder.

  content: Fascinating ideas. I hope you can eventually get one of your presentations
    online for those of us who do not live nearby. A speech at TED.com (and the resulting
    video) would be great.

Hopefully you're celebrating it your own way by <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">enjoying a map</a>, thanking a cartographer, or even doing <a href="http://openstreetmap.org" title="OpenStreetMap">some mapping yourself</a>! It's clear that mapping and geo have entered the mainstream - everyone is engaging with maps through navigation systems, friend location finders, and virtual globes. The next step is to make people aware of the potential for them to personally engage with place and location for personal interests, business uses, and community building.</p>
<p class="vevent"><abbr class="dtstart" title="2009-11-18T16:00:00-0500">This Wednesday</abbr>, I will be giving the <span class="description">GISDay plenary talk</span> at the <span class="location">University of Virginia</span> in Charlottesville. My talk, "Neogeography: from Tower to Town Hall" will discuss how the movement to broad, public engagement and collaboration, particularly around geographic contexts through web maps, mobile devices, and open data can build stronger communities, improved research, representative government and better livelihoods of people. (<a href="https://eventcal.itc.virginia.edu/eventcal/event/display?event_id=1252617989001">link to the UVA Calendar</a>)</p>
