  content: "Think different. Think bigger.\r\n\r\nThe guys at mp3car.com already have
    several active threads to develop an 'iDash' front end with Mac mini back end
    for carputers. It seems to me that cooling and power are the two not so small
    issues for an in-dash system. \r\n\r\nAnyway, something to ponder on a 40-minute
    commute.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=40051"

<p>Hrm, seems like it would be rather useful to pick up an <a href='http://www.apple.com/imacmini'>iMac Mini</a> as a mobile desktop. Similar to the <a href='http://www.cappuccinopc.com/'>Cappuccino mobile PC</a> that never took off. </p>
<p>At 6.5" x 2", it would be simple to toss this into a bag, go to work, plop it on the desk and perhaps into some kind of "dock connector" like they make for the iBook. Either that, or just plug in your monitor & power and use BT mouse & keyboard. Then pick it up and haul (term used <em>lightly</em>) home. A cheap desktop replacement.</p>
