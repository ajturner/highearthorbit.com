<p>Had a little lunch-time malt & barley at a local <del>dive</del> restaurant on Ft. Lauderdale Beach via <a href='http://www.shipyard.com/'>Shipyard Brewing Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SHIPYARD IPA - Feeling hoppy? Shipyard's IPA is a single-hopped ale that will satisfy any true India Pale Ale enthusiast. A wonderful balance and deceptively smooth.</blockquote></p>
<p>Hrm. It has a light golden color, and for a second I thought they had slipped me with some lager. However, after some more sampling, I could taste the I, P, and A. As a "true India Pale Ale enthustiast", while I may have been 'satisfied', I wasn't 'astounded'. In fact, while a good beer, I wouldn't order it again. But, if there weren't any mediocre beers, there wouldn't be as much fun in sampling the unknown.</p>
