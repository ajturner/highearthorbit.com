<p><a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2006-10-04" title="Tao of Mac: The Apple+Google Hype, iPhoto, and a Reality Check">Rui Carmo of Tao of Mac</a> has a good rundown of what the "found nugget" of Google url in iPhoto means. Really, very little. Besides, being a programmer, I toss in all kinds of little bits for testing and "look, cool!" internal playing that has nothing to do with any official partnerships/dealings. </p>
<p>I mean, I'm all for an Apple device that supports geolocation via GPS, Wifi, moss growth, Fido's nose. Bring it on, I will buy.</p>
<p>However, the neat thing I did like about Rui's post was a short demo of how easy it is to add Geographic coordinates and links to a Wiki:</p>
<p>Put </p>
<p><code>Geo http://maps.google.com/maps?t=k&q=</code> </p>
<p>in your <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Interwiki_linking" title="Wikimedia InterWikiMap">InterWikiMap</a>, and then you can put:</p>
<p><code>[Sample|Geo:42.4376472, -83.4727 (Northville, MI)]</code>  </p>
<p>to embed a location. </p>
