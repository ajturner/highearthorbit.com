  content: DashSaver worked in OS X 10.5 (Leopard), but it does not run in Snow Leopard
    (OS X 10.6), which seems to require them to be rewritten,

<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/dashsaver/DashSaver_Screenshot_Medium.jpg' align='right' hspace='5px' vspace='5px'/>I recently recompiled and released <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/software/dashsaver'>DashSaver</a> as a Universal Binary. It now will run fine on Intel and PowerPC computers. </p>
<p>Go give it a download. There are still two major feature requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Secure screensaver - when 'Ask for password on wake' is turned on, it will hide the dashboard</li>
<li>Dual Screens - the semi-transparent, colored background under DashSaver won't show up on the second monitor</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>You can also catch a great audio review of DashSaver over at the <a href='http://www.macreviewcast.com/?p=102'>MacReview Cast</a> (<a href='http://www.macreviewcast.com/podcasts/MacReviewCast49.mp3'>mp3</a>, it's at the beginning, the first reviewed freeware app)</p>
<p><strong>Update July 30, 2012</strong>: I've compiled a version for 10.6 and higher that you can <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/projects/dashsaver/DashSaver.saver.zip">download here</a>.</p>
