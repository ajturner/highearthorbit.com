<p><abbr title="Friday, October 24, 2008">Tomorrow</abbr> I'll be giving a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/e/1156" title="Webcast: Trends and Technologies in Where 2.0">webcast presentation</a> with O'Reilly: "Trends and Technologies in Where2.0". It will be a short presentation - approximately 20 minutes - then with about 40 minutes for question and answer discussion.</p>
<p>So if you want to ask anything about new and upcoming GeoWeb technologies, communities using geospatial technology, or businesses that are growing in the various spaces of geodata, locative mobile, or even just cool hacks then definitely register!<br /></p>
<p>My apologies to people in timezones that makes this occur on your Friday evening. Since it's participate at home, you can enjoy it over a nice beverage or meal.</p>
