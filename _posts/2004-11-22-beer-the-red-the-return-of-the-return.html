<p>Brewing the third edition of a Red Ale. It is, shall I say, a simple beer.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
---------------<br />
3lb. Plain Light Dry malt extract<br />
4lb. Edme Red Ale Malt Extract<br />
1 oz (5.7% alpha) Cascade Lead Hops<br />
California Ale Yeast [White Labs]</p>
<p>Ended up making a little more than 5 gallons, which probably accounts for the low specific gravity of 1.025. However, unlike the last red that was brewed at my place (Red the unmentioned), I am *not* leaving the primary fermentation bucket next to my water heater. ewwww... vinegar.</p>
