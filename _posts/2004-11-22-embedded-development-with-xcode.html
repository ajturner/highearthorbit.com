    with code-sense and click-to-error and other niceties! \r\n\r\nFor a template,
    check embedXcode. \r\n\r\nAs at today, both support Arduino 0023, Arduino 1.0,
    chipKIT 0023. Wiring 1.0 is on the pipes.\r\n\r\nMain page for documentation and

<p>Jim Schimpf has posted a HowTo on <a href='http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze35xda/xdev/index.html'>Embedded development with XCode</a> using the <a href='http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?family_id=607'>Atmel AVR</a> chip. I just talked to another engineer/software developer who says he loves these chips because they're (1) pretty powerful and have a multitude of options with serial, usb, parallel, ethernet, etc. ports, and (2) really cheap (~$10?).</p>
<p>Now looks like I can program them using XCode. <em>excellent</em> Of course, I wish XCode would stop sleeping on the job and work with CVS already! (yeah yeah, it says SCM, but have *you* gotten it to work?)</p>
