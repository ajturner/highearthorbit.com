  content: "As deCarta, also our company Mapscape working in the market of in-car
    and mobile navigation, is currently offering OpenStreetMap data in several map
    formats. One of them is GDF (Geographic Data Files), which is one of the most
    used standard exchange formats in the navigation industry.\r\n\r\nWe have started
    offering this data service to our customers, due to requests we have received
    with respect to feasibility of OSM for in-car navigation purposes. This goes a
    little bit further then only feasibility for development or map display purposes.
    Our technical team has dived into issues like addressibility, consistency of deliveries,
    cutting areas, stitching maps, GDF constraints, a.o. For companies interested,
    at this moment we can deliver fully navigable maps based on OSM!\r\n\r\nIt's nice
    to see that there are so many commercial initiatives on top of OSM. I wonder if
    the guys behind OSM have ever dreamed about this!"

  content: "@Harald - thanks for the additional info. \r\n\r\nIt is indeed the exact
    point of OpenStreetMap to create the free data so that companies, organizations,
    citizens, and governments can utilize the base information for multiple, specialized,
    uses.\r\n\r\nI'm interested to hear how deCarta is addressing the ODbL in terms
    of the changes required to enable navigation. For instance, many highways in the
    US were missing connectivity and turn restrictions - obviously necessary in national
    routing. Based on the license of OSM, these modifications will need to be freely
    shared back out. \r\n\r\nCan't wait to see the added quality deCarta brings to
    the data and community."

    uses of the data that don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t inadvertently expose their proprietary
    data. \"\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on that please?  What part of the licencing
    does this refer to?  I'd like to understand this better."

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/cageyjames/status/4054061179" title="@cageyjames decarta">Via @cageyjames </a> I saw the <a href="http://www.decarta.com/about/press_releases_2009/news_events_160909.htm" title="deCarta - Press Release">announcement that DeCarta</a> is now providing their services using OpenStreetMap data. It's tremendous to see more service providers building tools and businesses on top of open data.</p>
<p>It's this transition from primarily ground-swell supported projects into industry supported efforts that makes them sustainabile. Linux went through the same growth as providers like RedHat and Canonical started putting full-time and dedicated resources to ensuring the continual growth and stability of the projects.</p>
<p>This is perhaps very interesting news to <a href="http://cloudmade.com/" title="CloudMade Makes Maps Differently">CloudMade</a>, since it sits squarely in their market as well - and also Prioleau, the <strike>CEO</strike> former-CEO and now advisor of CloudMade <a href="http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/Prioleau-leaves-deCarta-to-become-CEO-at-CloudMade_a1433.html" title="Prioleau leaves deCarta to become CEO at CloudMade">was formerly a Vice President</a> of Marketing at deCarta.</p>

<em>CloudMade and DeCarta tiles using OpenStreetMap data</em></p>
<p>The deCarta tiles show the copyright "CCBYSAODBL", already including the forthcoming migration to <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/" title="Open Data Commons &Acirc;&raquo; Open Database License (ODbL)">the ODbL terms</a>. There have been many companies that are interested in integrating OpenStreetMap into their products but concerned about the potentially unclear terms or permitted uses of the data that don't inadvertently expose their proprietary data. Hopefully more moves like deCarta to utilizing OpenStreetMap in commercial products will provide clarity on the benefits and implications to other companies.</p>
