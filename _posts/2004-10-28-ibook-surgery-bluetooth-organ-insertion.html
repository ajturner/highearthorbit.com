<p>Timothy Hewitt, Esquire has a <a href='http://www3.telus.net/thewitt/BT/'>page on how to mod an ibook</a> to 'insert' a bluetooth module.  I, for one, am a known fan of Bluetooth.</p>
<p>However, a concern I have is the ability to turn off the Bluetooth Module. I don't mean just stopping people from connecting. I mean stopping power to the BT module in interests of battery life. I'll have to try that out first w/ an external BT module.</p>
