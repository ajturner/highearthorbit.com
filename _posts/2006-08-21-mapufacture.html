  content: "[...] Mikel and Andrew write about Mapufacture, a GeoRSS aggregator on
    which I have also worked. A user can create maps and add feeds to them. Maps are
    then shared with the other users. For example, one can follow the latest news
    on earthquakes or browse Reuters news by location. Thanks to Andrew&#8217;s tireless
    work, the site has made a lot of progress in the recent weeks and is now very
    usable. Please try it and send any feedback you may have. [...]"

  content: "[...] One of the projects demonstrated by Andy Turner at BarCamp Grand
    Rapids was Mapufacture. Developed by Andy, with Guilhem Vellut and Mikel Maron,
    the site functions as an RSS aggregator with a difference. As well as pulling
    in the latest content from feeds, it also extracts GeoRSS data from those feeds
    and plots the results on a google map. You can read an announcement here. [...]"

<p>I've gotten more involved with the <a href='http://georss.org' title='GeoRSS homepage'>GeoRSS</a> efforts and various tools to use <a href='http://georss.org' title='GeoRSS homepage'>GeoRSS</a> for aggregating geodata. After Where2.0, I started working on a project with <a href='http://brainoff.com' title="Mikel Maron's Homepage" rel="coworker">Mikel Maron</a> for consuming and mapping GeoRSS feeds. </p>
<p>The project is <a href='http://mapufacture.com/georss/' title='Mapufacture front page'>Mapufacture</a>. You can subscribe to feeds, create maps as collections of feeds, and share maps with other users. It's still in very active development (one could call it <em>beta</em>, but I won't), but is usable. <a href='http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/' title="Guilhem Vellut's homepage">Guilhem Vellut</a> is the person responsible for the very nice mapping via <a href='http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/ProjectsDoc/ym4r_mapstraction-doc/' title="YM4R Mapstraction documentation">YM4R_Mapstraction library</a>. If you'd like to give it a try and give feedback that would be great.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of useful maps created with Mapufacture:</p>
