  content: "A few points:\r\n\r\n1. There really is no expectation that DoD should
    be as open as other Federal Government branches. They've always acted under significant
    level of obfuscation. Right or wrong, they are the ones with the guns.\r\n\r\n2.
    $25M is a pretty small contract in DoD terms, The USAFA will spend probably 10X
    that much to retrain for another vendors product. The single-vendor status has
    allowed the USAF and the Academy to do things that no other school could. They
    don't teach any GIS classes. ArcGIS use is expected in all classes. \r\n\r\n3.
    For the DoD, ArcGIS is a platform - not just a software applicaton. ESRI has developed
    specific extensions for DoD and extensions have been developed internally to DoD
    that rely on ArcGIS as a platform.\r\n\r\nBut I have to agree with you that the
    vendor lock-in causing such extreme data interoperability and possible data inaccessibility
    is downright scary - especially considering how important GIS has become to the
    DoD."

  content: "Good points Eric - and \"open\" doesn't have to mean \"public\". It's
    obviously imperative that DoD be able to share information internally between
    appropriate operations and users. If this is at all impeded because of data formats,
    licenses, or incompatibilities is troubling indeed.\r\n\r\nAt the very least I
    would hope for clauses that state that the data must be at all times available
    using industry standards for interoperability - and the most appropriate platform
    used based on capabilities (such as operation specific features and extensions)."

  content: The DoD has standardized on ArcGIS - which provides considerable capability
    for interoperability. ESRI's licensing is surprisingly easy to deal with when
    you have a broad site license - like what the DoD  (and for that matter, the USGS
    or most universities) enjoy.

  content: They are also probably using the SDSFIE data model in ArcSDE with a number
    of complex extensions built around it.  Switching to another vendor, say Autodesk
    for example, would likely not make the data completely unusable but would create
    an enormous pain. $25M may not be much money for the US military but its a lot
    for the rest of us.  Building military operations around a single vendor is indeed
    scary.

  content: "@Eric\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with this is that I'd like to see an open
    procurement process.  I'm fine with proprietary if it meets the needs of warfighters,
    but I'm just not seeing this here.  \r\n\r\nThe issue here is implementation,
    an ESRI system should be as interoperable as any, but in the case of the Air Force,
    theirs is not.  To me it sounds like there should be a solicitation to fix their
    existing system."

  content: "Great call to the carpet, Andrew. \r\n\r\nEric, your argument that \"$25M
    is a pretty small contract in DoD terms\" is sad. I'm a taxpayer - I don't want
    the government spending needlessly because they can or because someone figures
    \"well hell, at least its not another Osprey program!\" \r\n\r\nYou suggest that
    they would spend 10X $25M to train on another vendor's product. \r\n\r\nReally
    - show me any one of the > 500 Million Google Earth users in the world that spent
    that much, if anything to \"train\" on using that software or any of the OpenStreetMap.org
    contributors, or geocommons contributors or users....\r\n\r\nThere is a big difference
    between teaching GIS and teaching ESRI's version of GIS - too many enter the field
    knowing how to push buttons, not understanding the algorithms underneath the tool.
    \r\n\r\nThat leads to bad maps, and I don't just mean cartographically - I mean
    bad maps because someone clicked a button in Military Analyst after guessing at
    parameters and now a decision maker has what looks like a compelling map in front
    of him to make his decisions off of. \r\n\r\nI'd hope students are taught to appreciate
    spatial analysis from all sources, not just one vendor's take on how to solve
    a particular problem.\r\n\r\nI wonder why a site ELA of this magnitude is even
    needed given NGA's mission and substantial investment in ESRI ELAs already. Shouldn't
    the students be learning how to call and evaluate geoprocessing results from those
    big NGA ArcGIS Server implementations?"

  content: "Most of our customers in the DoD (and commercial space) share a similar
    requirement with ESRI as the backbone/legacy infrastructure.  Normally a wrapper
    of custom applications, processing, and management tools exist that are built
    on top of this infrastructure year upon year for decades which \"justify\" #1
    and #2 above.  It is very difficult to move away from this infrastructure as this
    is maintained as core to the success of the operation, mission, or business (#5
    above). These dependencies also get thrown into the overall budget for subsequent
    years.   \r\n\r\nRecently, I've noticed the smaller and mid-size transitioning
    to open source and data interoperability to save money on infrastructure and do
    more with applications and problem solving. $25M (over 1 base 2 options) is quite
    a large contract in the geo market to spend on a single vendor but we've seen
    this before.  It's truly amazing where and how the money falls."

  content: "What I have noticed is that DoD gives lipservice to the concept of interoperability.
    \ ESRI gives lipservice to open standards and is as proprietary and closed as
    all get-out.  You need to work in a completely ESRI environment for the data to
    work, which is what this procurement is saying.\r\n\r\nSo what the Air Force is
    saying is that they're blowing off the requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act of
    1994 to support a completely closed, proprietary set of software (using the proprietary
    nature of that software as justification to continue using it--go figure!).  \r\n\r\nWhen
    is the Government going to get serious about forcing vendors to BE OPEN--not just
    use a very thin, shallow veneer of \"open standards\" like ESRI does.  (Ask anyone
    how they can reuse ESRI data structures--they're proprietary and cannot be reused,
    regardless of whatever people say.)"

  content: What I mean about the ESRI data structures is that the ArcSDE metalayer
    creates the ArcObjects which contain the topological structures that cannot be
    exported except by ESRI.  The structure of the ArcSDE metalayer is not published--so
    that if you have data in ArcSDE (or data outside of ArcSDE) you cannot fully extract
    the data from within or incorporate the data from outside EXCEPT THROUGH the metalayer.  The
    personal geodatabase is the alternative concept--also locked down tightly.  The
    "open" alternative is a shapefile--but that does not contain the topological information
    stored in the ArcSDE metalayer.  So are they conformant to OGC standards?  Are
    they interoperable?  Are they open?  I hardly think so!

  content: "A couple of points towards the original article:\r\n\r\nThe referenced
    USAF Academy solicitation is not an actual solicitation for vendors to procure
    new spatial software.  It was written by the 10th Civil Engineer Squadron specifically
    for the 10th Mission Support Group Contracting Office to explain why they (the
    contracting and procurement office) should use ESRI to renew the USAF Academy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    academic site license for ESRI products, and not another vendor to get an ESRI
    academic site license.  The simple reason for specifying ESRI is they are the
    single organization that can offer an academic site license for ESRI products.\r\n\r\nDue
    to Federal contracting rules and regulations, that explanation is not good enough.
    \ You need to have a more compelling reason, which the author of this document
    is trying to do.  All of the stated reasons for going with ESRI where written
    to satisfy a contracting official.  Obviously, what works for contract officials
    does not work for geospatial professionals.   \r\n\r\nA couple of points towards
    other comments:\r\n\r\nThe USAFA is not &acirc;&euro;&oelig;procuring&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    any new software.  They are only renewing the annual (academic site) license for
    what they already use.\r\n\r\nThe stated value of $25 million is incorrect (there
    is absolutely no way that a single base would be allowed to spend that much on
    software.  The USAFA can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get the $30 million they need to
    fix a leaking chapel, which is a national icon). I called the 10 CES, and they
    told me it is actually about $25 k.  This is a pretty good deal for the academy
    to have virtually unlimited access to ESRI software for academic and operational
    purposes.  \r\n\r\nESRI is not the only spatial software used at the USAFA.  Academic
    and research departments are using Google Earth (universally loved by Air Force
    members), Virtual Earth, WorldWind, PostreSQL/PostGIS, OpenLayers, GeoServer,
    and many other package, both professional, free, and/or open source.  \r\n\r\nOn
    the operational side of things at the USAFA, ESRI is the GIS mainstay (there is
    a lot of AutoCAD for engineering work).  Switching out ESRI is not pragmatic.
    \ Besides the costs associated with purchasing/switching software, training
    personnel, and the immediate impact on being able to provide support to customers,
    is the fact that any new software going on to an Air Force network need to go
    through a rigorous, time consuming, and expensive procedure to be authorized for
    use before it can be loaded on a single computer.\r\n\r\nAir Force installations
    have had a standards based program, called GeoBase, which has advocated the use
    of OGC standards since 2003. In fact, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1994 was explicitly
    used to help direct the need for these standards.  The central mission statement
    of GeoBase is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;One Base .. One Map&acirc;&euro;\x9D.  It was
    not uncommon 10 years ago for installations to be mapped several times to meet
    the data requirements for multiple software systems.  GeoBase aimed to create
    an authoritative mapping data source that could be accessed as a vendor neutral
    service for any system that required a mapping component.  A lot of money has
    been saved with GeoBase mapping procedures.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER\r\n\r\nThere is truth
    to virtually every comment made here in regards to the Air Force, and the DoD
    as a whole. I could go on for hours as to why this is the case, but the bottom
    line is that a lot of work needs to take place to break down the data and system
    silos that exist across the Air Force."

  content: "Thanks for the insight and clarification Tim. \r\n\r\nA couple of points
    I'd like to know more about:\r\n\r\n- If the license really is just $25k, then
    why does the solicitation still ask for $25m? This isn't a doubling, or quadrupling,
    it is 3 orders of magnitude!\r\n\r\n- Are there examples of the various geospatial
    tools that are being used, how they're operating together, and how they're incorporated
    into the curriculum?\r\n\r\n- I can understand differentiation between actual
    requirements and solicitation requirements - but the stated reasons aren't inadequate,
    they're strongly indicative of deep problems or expectations. The last point in
    particular \"making all of the existing GIS data non-usable\" is not unambiguous."

  content: "I believe that the solicitation has a typographical error ($25,000,000.000
    as opposed to $25,000.000).   Either that or $25 million is the ceiling on what
    can be applied to the contract vehicle they are using (which has no real bearing
    on the actual amount used).  I am more convinced of the former, since the numbers
    are so closing related.  This is the standard price for ESRI academic licenses,
    with a couple of examples below:\r\n \r\nhttp://www.kars.ku.edu/user/schedule.shtml\r\nhttps://rcc.sr.unh.edu/ESRI/GeneralInfo.pm/\r\n\r\nThe
    last statement, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;making all of the existing GIS data non-usable&acirc;&euro;\x9D,
    is a bit strong, but is intended to end the internal debate between CE and contracting
    as to whether or not they should spend time looking for another vendor that can
    renew the academic site license (no one else can).  But even if the USAFA was
    completely interoperable, they can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t use the data if their
    database software, regardless of who the vendor is, quits working because the
    license has expired.\r\n\r\nYour central theme is correct.  While interoperability
    has been preached heavily, certain policy and historical factors have led to a
    virtual vendor lock-in in most cases."

The <em>solicitation</em> is a sole-source justification for license renewal of ESRI software for $25 million USD.</p>
<p>While government procurement makes things like sole-sourcing common as a mechanism to just renew license - it is really the supporting justifications for this sole-sourcing that are disconcerting.</p><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=01da8bda20d8acaa50c7af0bba1f980c&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0&amp;cck=1&amp;au=&amp;ck=">From the solicitiation</a>: "ESRI is the only source that can satisfy the needs of the government for the following reasons."</p>
<ol>
<li>The Geospatial Information System section within the 10th Civil Engineering squadron has been using ESRI software since their initial development eight years ago.</li>
<li>All of the past and present mapping and client specification have been developed using ESRI software products.</li>
<li>The Dean of Faculty's Geography department also uses the ESRI academic site license for teaching all Geographical Information System coursework to the cadets.</li>
<li>Software standardization between the 10th CES, DFEG, and the entire USAFA is extremely critical.</li>
<li>Compatibility allows GIS data sharing between all agencies on the USAFA will continue to support GIS development in the future.</li>
<li>Award of this contract to another contractor would jeopardize the performance of our mission by making all of the existing GIS data non-usable.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>Which of those reasons are legitimate to the missions of the government and defense, and which are indicative of a more endemic problem of vendor lockin?</p>
<p>The points of the critical nature of compatibility are very important. Data and information must freely flow between sources, analysts, consumers, observers, and archiving. In addition, there are definitely costs to retraining and maintenance that affects changing or introducing new software.</p>
<p>However, the majority of reasons provided by the solicitation point to legacy decisions, old implementations, academic education of specific vendors (<a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/programs/academia_cd/techkit_academia.html" title="The MathWorks United Kingdom - Free MATLAB &amp; Simulink in Academia CD Offer">definitely</a> not <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aR2VjQFEqpew">uncommon</a>), and the bold closing statement that the data from these software packages is not usable in any other tools.</p>
<p>It's that last particular point that should be the most disturbing to the administration. Apparently all geospatial data being developed and utilized by the USAFA would be unusable without a sole software vendor. This causes concern over broader interoperability with other agencies and organizations, access to important national information, and archivability and retrievability.</p>
<p>The fault here isn't on ESRI. They offer an <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/standards/index.html" title="GIS and IT Standards Overview">interoperability suite</a> that supports OGC, ISO, and other standards that agencies could utilize. The fault lies with the government contracting that justifies this type of reasoning of renewal and continuation <em>because</em> of single-vendor lockin. There is little excuse that open, compatible interfaces should be part of such a large contract.</p>
<p>I wonder when software licenses and interoperability spending will show up in the <a href="http://it.usaspending.gov/" title="Federal IT Dashboard">USASpending IT Dashboard</a>?</p>
