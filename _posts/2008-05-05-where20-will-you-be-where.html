</a>Are you ready for it?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.oreilly.com/where2008/">Where2.0</a> starts in one week, with the free and avant-garde <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/" title="WhereCamp wiki - alternative conferences for geohacker...">WhereCamp</a> the weekend after. I think <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2008/public/content/about#program_committee" title="About: Where 2.0 Conference 2008 '&rdquo; O'Reilly Conferences, May 12 - 14, 2008, Burlingame, CA">the team pulled together</a> a great program that captures many of the new companies and concepts of the morphing Geographic space.</p>
<p> Unfortunately not everyone that deserves the opportunity to speak got a slot. There are also very few returning speakers - we want to hear from new innovators. The conference is single track - which means we're all part of the same conversation, and talks are already limited to 5-15 minutes so it's a whirlwind of energy and ideas. That's why <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/" title="WhereCamp wiki - alternative conferences for geohacker...">WhereCamp</a> is the perfect venue to really engage and still share your ideas with a broader community.</p>
<p><a href="http://brainoff.com" title="BrainOff: Mikel Maron" rel="coworker">Mikel</a>, <a href="http://www.asklater.com/steve/" title="AskLater">Steve</a>, and I are <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2008/public/schedule/detail/1673" title="Geo-ify Your Web Site: Where 2.0 Conference 2008 '&rdquo; O'Reilly Conferences, May 12 - 14, 2008, Burlingame, CA">giving a workshop</a> essentially talking about Neogeography and integrating geo-data and services into your web applications.</p>
<p>Monday night I'm giving a 20-by-20 (20 slides, 20-seconds per slide) lightning talk at Ignite titled "Building Customized Slices of the GeoWeb". I'll be sure to share the slides (once I've actually made them)</p>
<p>And I also have a couple of other things in the works that will be released as well that I'll be able to talk about soon. Overall it's going to be a really exciting, and crazy week. I'm thrilled looking forward to the inspirations and conversations that will happen at the conferences.</p><br /></p>
