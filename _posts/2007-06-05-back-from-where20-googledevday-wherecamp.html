  content: "Thanks Steven - I will be posting about that shortly, after I work out
    the final little kinks and post it all to opensearch.org. It is amazing how sometimes
    a standard can just \"come together\" like that. \r\n\r\nEspecially when you spring
    it on a small, select group like that. ;) Hopefully it will gain wide-spread support."

<p>I'm back home from a grueling and invigorating trip to the left-coast to geek on all things 'location'. Unfortunately I got little time to blog myself, but I made lots of notes and am trying to digitize them all. I'll be blogging about some of my own specific announcements that came out at Where2.0 shortly.</p>
<p>Google's Dev Day was in fact the cattle drive I was worried it might be. However, it was still an incredibly fun event because of the hallway track and getting to meet a large number of the Google 'geo' team, as well as various <a href="http://geobloggers.com">others</a> from <a href="http://flickr.com">other</a> companies.</p>
<p>Apparently I was part of a "geo digerati" party, check out the <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/stunts/spoof-valleywag-party-report-265404.php" title="Spoof Valleywag Party Report">reciprocal ValleyWag post</a>. Congrats to <a href="http://blog.urbanmapping.com/" title="Urban Mapping Blog">Ian</a> and the <a href="http://urbanmapping.com" title="Urban Mapping" rel="coworker">Urban Mapping</a> team.</p>
<p>One of the more mind-boggling things at <a href="http://wherecamp.org/" title="WhereCamp">WhereCamp</a> was Mikel building a mashup <em>into</em> someone else's site. You can now automatically see Google <abbr title="Panoramic Images">Pano</abbr>'s of Upcoming event locations within Upcoming. I do truly hope that the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/95853/" title="WebKit Open Source Party">WebKit</a> party was a blast - looked like it was going to be one based on their pano's. </p>
<p>For the in-depth info, check out all the <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wherecamp" title="Technorati: wherecamp">social</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?l=cc&w=all&q=wherecamp&m=tags" title="Flickr photos: wherecamp">sites</a> with the tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/wherecamp">wherecamp</a>. For extra geekiness, tags I made use a machine-tag for the specific session. <em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/wherecamp:session%3Dlightningtalks">wherecamp:session=lightningtalks</a></p>
<p>a couple of highlights off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great conversations on the <a href="http://del.icio.us/nilspace/wherecamp:session%3Dgistofanarea" title="del.icio.us bookmarks for WhereCamp: Gist of an Area">"Gist of an Area"</a> with Travis of <a href="http://www.neighboroo.com/">Neighboroo</a>, Tim with <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/" rel="coworker">ThinkWhere</a>/<a href="http://geocodr.net" title="Geocodr">Geocodr</a></li>
<li>Being amazed by the <a href="http://polytransit.com/" title="PolyTransit">skill</a> and <a href="http://gregsadetsky.com/" title="Greg Sadetsky blog">wit</a> of <a href="http://poly9.com/">Poly9</a>. They type too fast for their own good.</li>
<li>Lightning talks from <a href="http://www.geotude.com/">GeoTude</a></li>
<li>dancing to <em>Viscious Groove</em></li><br />
</ul></p>
