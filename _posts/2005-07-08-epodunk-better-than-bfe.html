  content: "I think you're confusing technology and content.  \r\n\r\nIf a reference
    work, such as an encyclopedia, is renamed an \"API,\" the publisher should then
    freely available to others? This is similar to the stance of Google, in trying
    to index books under copyright. \r\n\r\nOur site, ePodunk, is not simply a \"conglomeration\"
    of other databases. It's the result of years of ongoing research, from government
    data, books, records, personal visits, and other sources.  The information has
    been compiled by seasoned journalists, and is delivered through technology that
    we've personally funded. \r\n\r\nBy placing the focus on the delivery mechanism
    - the technology - you and Google have decided that content should automatically
    be in the public realm.  This is a viewpoint where technology reigns, and \"information
    wants to be free.\"\r\n\r\nI come from a world where quality content  can't be
    automated."

  content: "API means Application Programming Interface, but really has come to mean
    programmatic interface to a resource (desktop app, framework, or in this case
    web service). An API is a \"publicized\" interface to this resource. An API does
    <b>not</b> have to be free, but if it is called API (this theoretical encyclopedia)
    then it implies that it is accessible via defined interface for incorporation
    into other locations. There are many API's that are a service charge. For example,
    see Maxmind.com and others that provide geo-ip lookups which users can purchase
    per lookup.\r\n\r\nI also don't doubt that ePodunk has been a lot of work and
    research to bring it together. It is a conglomeration/combination/mash-up
    of publicly available information (largely). ePodunk has performed a service in
    gathering these sources and providing them in a single resource to the user. \r\n\r\nI
    also assume this gathering is <em>automated</em> as I highly doubt anyone
    sits down and copies/pastes information for every town from every source.
    Yet I would argue this automated process is still provides quality content. Hrm...\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    the point wasn't that the technology was the focus. And I don't think myself or
    google said that all content should be in the public realm. My original post said
    that ePodunk neither provided nor <em>licensed</em> (i.e. not free of charge)
    their API. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you are confusing with the word free: there is free
    of charge, and free as in freedom. I personally believe in the latter. People
    want to earn a living, buy things, and generally have financial independence.
    I applaud their efforts and work and I myself develop commercial applications
    and data. \r\n\r\nHowever, I also think that a valuable resource of data <em>could</em>
    do a great service by giving freedom to the content and allow it to propogate.
    \ Let us use a time-honored word for what this is called: <em>Syndication</em>.
    \r\n\r\nAs the Associated Press is well aware, a technique like Syndication can
    be very powerful and profitable. It is only when we discuss <em>how</em> to
    syndicate do we mention technology. And based on the business model a group can
    choose to syndicate for free of charge or as a charged service. Again, this is
    removed from the discussion of technology. Take for example the US Census TIGER
    data. That  resource has been widely spread and reused due to the availability
    of the information.\r\n\r\nePodunk seems like a great resource, and it is because
    of its content that I see great potential in licensing/providing an interface
    for other sites, users, applications to use this data.  I merely mentioned a consideration
    ePodunk and other web services may want to think about."

  content: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nYou write: \"I also assume this gathering is automated
    as I highly doubt anyone sits down and copies/pastes information for every
    town from every source. Yet I would argue this automated process is still provides
    quality content. Hrm'&brvbar;\"\r\n\r\nThat's the nugget of where
    you've gone wrong. We do, in fact, research every community individually and type
    in entries one at a time. \r\n\r\nThere are, of course, exceptions to this. Census
    data, for example, is downloaded from the Census Bureau and reformatted for our
    site. You note the census as an example of information that can be downloaded
    and syndicated. Absolutely correct. But the difference is that it's compiled by
    a government agency spending public tax dollars, not by individuals working in
    the private sector.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press does syndicate, but over much
    of its history it syndicated to the members who provided the content. There are
    many in the news business who object to their relatively recent expansion to organizations
    that do not provide content.\r\n\r\nBut back to your assumption that we are a
    conglomeration of automated content: If data collection were totally automated,
    there would be no new information gathered, no individuals interviewed, no direct
    observations made and recorded. Every new site would simply be a rechurning and
    reorganization of other information available elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't disagree
    more with this approach. For instance, we just spent several weeks traveling through
    Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Prince Edward Island, gathering
    information first-hand for our new Canada site.\r\n\r\nThis may seem old fashioned
    to you. But it really shows the technology bias in your posting. \r\n"

  content: As you stated,Miss Bennet, You started gathering information last October
    for your new ePodunk Canada site. I have thus been patient so far, but how much
    more patient must I be until you complete it? scarecrowpete@cs.com

<p><a href='http://www.epodunk.com/'>ePodunk</a> (the power of place) is an online location resource for the US. It lists newspapers, events, geneology, restaurants, lodging, weather, photos, obituaries, government, census, history, health, and much, much more. Let us sum it up by saying <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=comprehensive'>"comprehensive"</a>.</p>
<p>They license access to their databases (which are really just a conglomeration of hundreds of <em>other</em> databases). I'm trying to find out if the API is accessible to tie into other web apps.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=22021'>ePodunk: Northville, MI</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> - ePodunk has chosen to close off their API and doesn't even currently license their technology to users/vendors. This requires people to travel to ePodunk to get information. I can understand the need for a revenue base, however, charging a license or obtaining some other means of revenue generation while opening up an API seems beneficial. </p>
<p>Perhaps they should check out the O'Reilly talk on how an Open API can greatly help your emerging business, <a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6026'>Web Services as a Strategy for Startups: Opening Up and Letting Go</a>.</p>
