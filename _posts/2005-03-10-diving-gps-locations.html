<p>When I dove in Puerto Rico, I had just gotten my trusty <a href='http://www.garmin.com/products/etrex/'>Garmin eTrex</a> GPS receiver and was all excited to use it. However, the small, and excellent, <a href='http://www.diveguide.com/p2444.htm'>dive company</a> we went through in beautiful (if small and empty) Parguera, was non-too-keen on my logging the exact locations of their coveted dive locations.</p>
<p>As I came to understand, their knowledge of good dive locations was the IP (intellectual Property) and really gave value to their company. Of course, on the Carribbean side of Puerto Rico, I imagine there are many, many good dive spots.</p>
<p>Well, I guess in the lingo/jango we can all this open-diving location, but you can get your fill of GPS diving sites at <a href='http://www.divingdestinations.net/divesites.cfm'>Diving Destinations.net</a>. Well, as long as your fill is 515 sites (to date).</p>
