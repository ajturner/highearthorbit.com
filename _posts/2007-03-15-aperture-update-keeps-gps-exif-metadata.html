  content: "Hello. I came across your post in searching for information about using
    the Pertelian LCD display with Max OS X. Do you know of resources out there that
    might help me?\r\n\r\nWhile I'd like to have it display weather information, etc.,
    what I would really like to be able to do is display messages I send to it (via
    the computer to which it is attached) via the internet. E.g., so that when I am
    at work I can have it display a message to my wife that I'll be 30 minutes late.
    With the developer resources that are available, how difficult would that be?\r\n\r\nI
    have Unix and perl experience, but no experience with drivers, low-level OS X
    stuff, nor programming for OS X (besides some RealBasic and CLI perl applications)\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help!"

<p>I haven't tried it yet, but the new <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305121">Mac OS 10.4.9 update</a> fixes a problem in Aperture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
GPS metadata is preserved when image versions are exported.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>And there was much rejoicing... <em>Yay!</em></p>
<p>This is actually a really common problem with most photo-editing programs. You're lucky if they retain much, if any, of the EXIF metadata for an image. All that time spent putting in Copyright, Headline, Caption, Location, Subject, etc. is usually probably lost the minute you export to JPG or upload to Flickr. It's nice to see applications, especially professional-grade ones, supporting the additional metadata. </p>
<p>The Update addresses another issue I ran into the other day:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Addresses an issue in which incorrect encoding could be used for the files created by the 'New Text File'¬ù Automator action on Intel-based Macs.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I was trying to setup Automator actions for my <a href="http://www.pertelian.com/index.php">Pertelian X2040 LCD</a> in an upcoming <a href="http://mactech.com" title="MacTech homepage">MacTech Magazine</a> article. Now I can add lines for upcoming iCal events, Mail messages, and perhaps even pipe these out to my NabazTag!</p>
