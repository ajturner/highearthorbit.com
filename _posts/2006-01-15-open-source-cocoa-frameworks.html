<p><a href='http://www.cocoatech.com'>CocoaTech</a> has released PathFinder 4, the 'Finder replacement' on Mac OS X (which is both hard since the Finder is baked into the OS and included, but easy since the Finder doesn't really provide much actual UI). I haven't used PathFinder much before, since it had publicly stangated on v3 and I am happy enough with the Finder and the awesome ability to press <Cmd>-<Shift>-G to bring up a tab-completing text entry for going to locations. </p>
<p>But what really impressed me was their new <a href='http://www.cocoatech.com/opensource.php'>Open Source projects</a>. Their open-sourcing their plugin-in interface, their internal and powerful frameworks, and <em>CocoaTechTerminal</em> which allows developers to put a terminal within an NSView in their applications. </p>
<p>A company with solid code, releasing parts of their code-base in open-source is unadulterated <em>awesome</em> and much to be applauded. I'm downloading PathFinder 4 just <strong>because</strong> of their open-source coolness and will give it a try and may purchase it. </p>
<p>Since I'm on the topic of people making very developer friendly add-ons, I recently came across <a href='http://homepage.mac.com/jrc/contrib/'>John R Change Contributed projects</a>, which include a better NSStream, a case-insensitive NSDictionary, a category of NSString that adds support for matching regular expressions, and other Cocoa add-ons and classes. </p>
<p>There are many, many more libraries out there. Just watch <a href='http://www.cocoadev.com'>CocoaDev</a>, a developer Wiki that is active (if sometimes chaotic) documentation, discussion, and resources on Cocoa libraries. </p>
