  content: "Hi i currently develop an opensource framework for worldwide geocoding,
    strretsearch, find nearby, an postal code search. it consist of some full integrated
    webservices (fulltext, find nearby, geocoding, etc ) and an importer for geonames.org
    and openstreetmap. the geonames importer and webservices is up since january,
    the openstreetmap is in beta state. i am currently alone on the project\r\n\r\nwebservices
    can output a lot of language : python ,ruby, php, XML, JSON, Atom,GEORSS\r\n\r\ni
    hope to put a stable release in one or two month.\r\n\r\nyou can see a demo at
    services.gisgraphy.com (only geonames data for the moment, openstreetmap will
    come soon)"

  content: "@gisgraphy - yes, I've looked at the framework and it's very interesting.
    It would be great to see how we can all work together to share ideas, code, and
    successes."

  content: This is awesome. I have been looking for this for a very long time. Have
    talked to multiple geocoding vendors in the USA and I must say these vendors are
    living in dark ages in terms of sharing/selling geodata. One says its $0.01
    per geocode, other says no caching, yet another says use only the webservice,
    and license it only through VARs, no yearly payment means no use of previously
    geocoded data etc.

  content: "This is great... but data is still my #1 problem.  TIGER seems to be infrequently
    updated.  Our users seem to expect better.\r\n\r\nAs long as we're throwing around
    stimulus money, maybe we should put some into funding frequent updating of some
    public address data."

  content: "@darkness - yes Data has been a problem, which led to a \"chicken &amp;
    egg\" problem with building a better open-source geocoder. Our geocoder can import
    TIGER data or NAVTEQ data - for people that have licensed the commercial data.\r\n\r\nIn
    the future, we're working with OpenStreetMap to build out addresses in that open
    database.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly - US Census is about to release an updated TIGER that
    purportedly has very improved quality. Updates actually have been coming out every
    year or so I believe."

  content: "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nThis is great news!  I actually just released (beta)
    an IP address geocoder - it will do batches directly on the website, and there's
    an API for (single) remote requests.  I couldn't find what I needed, so I created
    one. Hoping to fill a hole.\r\n\r\nbatchiplocator.webatu.com\r\n\r\nCheers"

    services with Openstreet map data.\r\nPresently i have all the data dump in my
    local postgres database.\r\ni want to implement routing services based on openstreet
    map data.\r\n Apart from that I have implemented map with all the features using
    OpenLayers. Could you please comment on any framework or tool so that i use the
    data for routing.\r\n\r\nAwaiting for your response.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSunil"

You can get the LGPL-licensed code on <a href="http://github.com/geocommons/geocoder">GitHub</a> and also check out my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/geocommons-opensource-geocoder" title="GeoCommons Open-Source GeoCoder">lightning talk presentation</a> announcement on Slideshare.</p>
<p>The geocoder was built as part of our FGDC CAP Grant to help <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/grants/2009CAP/projects/G09AC00107">GeoEnable Government Tabular Data</a> and utilizes the free and open TIGER/Line street data as well as various address parsing and metaphone components for US level address parsing. Also, not everyone can call to a web-service, abide by the terms of service, or be limited by the speed and amount of geocoding queries.</p>
<p>The reason we're open-sourcing it because primarily an open-source geocoder has been a sorely missing piece of the open-source geospatial stack. You have <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/" title="PostGIS : Home">storage</a>, <a href="http://www.osor.eu/case_studies/sextante-a-geographic-information-system-for-the-spanish-region-of-extremadura">analysis</a>, <a href="http://modestmaps.com/">rendering</a>, geolocation, and even <a href="http://graphserver.sourceforge.net/" title="Graphserver - The Open-Source Multi-Modal Trip Planner">routing</a> - but not geocoding, at least not in an active project way. <a href="http://geocoder.us/" title="geocoder.us: a free US address geocoder">GeoCoder::US</a> has been around for a long-time and well built, in Perl, and despite it's long-standing solid service at geocoder.us, it didn't fit our needs.<br /></p>
<p>So instead we worked closely with <a href="http://iconocla.st/" title="iconocla.st -- a weblog by Schuyler D. Erle">Schuyler Erle</a>, one of the original developers of GeoCoder::US, to rebuild it in a modular way (in fact he finished it once and promptly rebuilt it again), and also in a popular, modern language, Ruby(that we happen to use as well).</p>
<p>We're also hoping to engage the community in building out the Geocoder. Right now it has components for the United States - but we hope that others will add components for their countries. <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> is coming along very well with adding both ranged, and even parcel level, address data. So a good first task would be to build out an OpenStreetMap data importer.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out the code on <a href="http://github.com/geocommons/geocoder">GitHub</a> - fork it, let us know what you're working on, any issues you run into, and how we can make the best, and open-source, geocoder out there. Look forward to more detailed posts on how we built it and how we're using it in <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons</a> and <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com/cloud">GeoIQ</a>.</p>
