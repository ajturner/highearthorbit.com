<p>After my little upset-ness the other day from GoogleMaps changing it's API, I found out they have <a href='http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/'>documented the API</a> (via <a href='http://the.taoofmac.com/space'>Tao of Mac</a>)</p>
<p>This API covers all the basics that people like <a href='http://stuff.rancidbacon.com/google-maps-embed-how-to/'>Rancid Bacon</a> had derived from lots of digging. It also enlightens us how to add lines, navigation, and even animation!</p>
<p>Now I can fix my <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location/'>Travelogue</a> application and add some more features I've been thinking about.  </p>
