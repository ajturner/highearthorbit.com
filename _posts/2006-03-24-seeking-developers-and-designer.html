<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-unclesamwantsyou.jpg' alt='Uncle Sam Want You' align='right' hspace='5px' vspace='5px'/>I am working on a large project with a good potential future and am seeking a couple of developers and a designer. If you want to work on a cutting edge, dynamic, fun & interesting application with the possibility of a broader future, then let me know. There is a prototype done, but I am looking for some help in getting the features all complete and ready for public roll-out. </p>
<p>More specifically, the application is a server/desktop/mobile hybrid, and deals with a lot of items that have come across this blog. Think along the lines of <a href='http://www.plazes.com/'>Plazes</a>, <a href='http://www.platial.com/'>Platial</a>, <a href='http://mobileplay.com'>MobilePlay</a>, <a href='http://www.mologogo.com/'>Mologogo</a>, and my own <a href='http://highearhorbit.com/projects/location'>Travelogue</a>. </p>
<p>There are 2 developer spots: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby/Rails, web development</li>
<li>J2ME/Python for mobiles</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The designer should be versed in web design methods, CSS/XHTML, User interface for desktop and mobile apps (or willing to quickly learn). </p>
<p>If you're interested in finding out more and helping out, please email me at <a href="mailto:software@highearthorbit.com">software@highearthorbit.com</a>. Please include references to some other projects, code, or designs that you've worked on. </p>
<p>(By the way, anyone from any country/time-zone/culture is welcome, despite the "Uncle Sam" personage. I just felt he embodied the message: "We want you!")</p>
