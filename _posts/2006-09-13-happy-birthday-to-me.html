  content: "Well, we've got upgraded Wisdom, and a speed-bump in Intelligence. You'll
    notice a higher power draw, and some reduced speed. We're hoping to do some future
    optimization to fix these issues (but like most promised optimizations, this is
    probably vaporware).\r\n\r\nAlso, we should have clarified: this is v29.0 Release
    Candidate 1. Please file all bugs so they may be addressed before we go 'gold'.
    :)"

  content: Holy cow you're old!  AJP 26.0 is coming up. I don't know if I add more
    features, but I've definitely added some bloat.

  content: "The nice thing is that the plugin architecture is largely complete. Unfortunately,
    the plugins themselves are increasingly expensive and more elaborate and aging
    plugins just aren't as optimized.\r\n\r\nRC 2.0 ran fine with the plugin \"Cardboard
    Box\"\r\nRC 29.0 requires plugin \"Hackable Prius\" or somesuch to achieve similar
    performance results.\r\n"

<p>And spending your birthday away from friends and loved ones can be sad. Best wishes to <a href='http://verdantconcepts.com' title='VerdantConcepts'>those that I'm not with</a>.</p>
