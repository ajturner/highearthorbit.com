We discussed a wide range of topics on the state and future of map making. Open data communities such as Openstreetmap, location ads, Google and Apple's new platforms, augmented reality and more.</p>
<p>I truly enjoy thought provoking conversations that think more broadly about the domain and where it's going. I hope you enjoy the interview and please let me know any comments or thoughts you have.</p>
