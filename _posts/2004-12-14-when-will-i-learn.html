<p>To actually pitch my ideas or use them in some way?</p>
<p>While ripping through my girlfriends CD collection for her music library, I thought "hrm, wouldn't it be nice if there was a service that did this for you. There are probably hundreds of people each night, slaving through their CD collection, ripping them, waiting, checking the tracks, ripping the next, hoping it's a good rip. Etc."</p>
<p>Well, <a href='http://www.ripdigital.com/'>lo and behold</a> someone has done this. Of course, what seems really attractive is to make a music library of discs you've ripped, and as new CD's come in to be ripped, instead of going through the encoding process again, just pull them out of your digital library. Eventually you'll have most of the major CD's covered, and will only have to encode obscure CD's.</p>
