  content: "With the X10 light switches, the first command is sent to address the
    device, then the second command is to set the brightness.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"on\"
    is sent, the device is address only, the \"on\" is not executed even if the light
    is off.  \r\n\r\nWhen \"off\" is sent the device is addressed and the command
    is executed.  This causes the light to switch off, turn on and then dim to the
    desired setting.\r\n\r\nIs there a way, in the Preferences, or some kind of cohesion
    to you, to change the \"off\" to an \"on\" sent by the Widget?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Steve"

<p>Since remote access via the IndigoWidget was such a popular feature - and not everyone is a programmer, I have moved setting remote control via the IndigoWidget as a preference on the backside of the widget.</p>
<p>You can download the new version from <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/software/indigowidget/'>the software page</a>. There is also an included Readme that discusses setting up your widget over to work over the internet back to your house or office.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy! </p>

<h2>troglogdyte speak</h2><br />
For those interested, coding up preferences for a Dashboard widget are actually impressively straight-forward and easy. </p>
<p>The only two lines of code that are <em>special</em> are the following which get and set the preference for the widget:</p>
<pre><code><br />
    var IndigoServerIP  = widget.preferenceForKey("serverIP");<br />
    if(IndigoServerIP  != '')<br />
        getObj("serverIP").value = IndigoServerIP;  </p>
<p>    widget.setPreferenceForKey(getObj("serverIP").value, "serverIP");<br />
</code></pre></p>
<p>Assumedly these are stored by the name of the widget (e.g. com.highearthorbit.widget.Indigo).</p>
