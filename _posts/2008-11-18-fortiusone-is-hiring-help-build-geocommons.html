  content: "We're also pushing the next generation of GeoWeb standards:
    KML, GeoRSS, GeoJSON, and making them more powerful and supported.\r\n\r\nYes.
    This is actual standards\r\nWe use now all this also :)\r\nhttp://maptest.eastgeology.com/\r\n\r\nMaybe

Want to help build the next generation social mapping tools and work on some really awesome technology?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons - Visual Analytics through Maps">GeoCommons</a> team is expanding and we're looking for some cutting-edge developers and designers to join us. We're using a wide range of technologies to build an easy-to-use and incredibly powerful <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons Finder!">geodata sharing</a>, <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons Maker!">visualization</a>, and <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons - Visual Analytics through Maps">collaboration platform</a> that is being used in organizations from the government, to enterprise, to international NGO's, to local communities and groups.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2008/11/gustav-maker-storm-surge.jpg" width="250" height="161" alt="gustav_maker_storm_surge.jpg" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" />With GeoCommons, we're integrating Neogeography with GIS to provide powerful tools to users: if you can make it fun on the web where users aren't required to stay, then customers will love you. And by integrating with other tools that each user is comfortable with, whether it is Excel, Notepad, GoogleEarth, or ArcGIS Desktop and QGIS; we help bring GeoCommons to them rather than making them come to GeoCommons. We're also pushing the next generation of GeoWeb standards: KML, GeoRSS, GeoJSON, and making them more powerful and supported. These are ideas we started with <a href="http://mapufacture.com/" title="Mapufacture - helping build the geospatial web">Mapufacture</a> and are quickly integrating with <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Finder!">Finder!</a>, <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">Maker!</a> and the rest of the GeoCommons suite.</p>
<p>As a part of our team, you would investigate large-scale data sharing and linking, geospatial and data visualization mechanisms and tool development, web native API integration and community building. We're working with many other groups in the open-source as well as GIS communities to help integrate data and tools to broadly disseminate all this quality data that has otherwise been inaccessible and make it easy to visualize and use in decision-making.</p>
<p>We're looking for developers with real programming chops - you should be comfortable considering Mongrel and Nginx versus Passenger, know when to use unobtrusive Javascript or call ActionScript Flash hooks, have played with ActiveMQ and Stomp, beanstalkd, Starling or other queueing systems, read technology news and blogs and preferably have a site yourself where you share your experiences and code with the world. We're looking for community members and developers that like working in teams, attending programming groups, and are comfortable sharing their ideas. We encourage you to have hobbies and side projects - we've built quite a few 'lab' tools ourselves such as context-free music and touchscreen whiteboards. And you don't <strong>have</strong> to be an Apple user, <em>but it helps</em>.</p>

Where else can you live in a "metro area" that encompasses at least 3 states, all of which are metro accessible? The area is also renowned for it's <a href="http://www.outsideindc.com/bikes" title="DC Bikes">bike accessibility</a>. The recent election has cast a spotlight on the future of technology in the government with President-Elect Obama's <a href="http://change.gov/" title="Change.gov">Change.gov</a> initiative. The upcoming inauguration is sure to be an incredibly historic event and you could be here to help map it.</p>
<p>As for the community, there are at least three <a href="http://novarug.org/" title="NovaRUG">Ruby</a>-<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/potomac-ruby-hackers" title="Potomac Ruby Hackers | Google Groups">specific</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/DCRUG" title="Washington DC Ruby on Rails Users Group DCRUG | Google Groups">groups</a>, a <a href="http://www.novalang.org/" title="Nova Languages">NOVALang</a> where learning new programming languages is the prime objective, <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/" title="Refresh DC | The best and brightest new media professionals in the DC metro area">RefreshDC</a>, TwinTech, and one of the most <a href="http://data.octo.dc.gov/" title="Data Catalog">open governments</a> to geodata standards and <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/" title="Apps for Democracy - An Innovation Contest by iStrategyLabs for the DC Government and Beyond">sharing</a>.
