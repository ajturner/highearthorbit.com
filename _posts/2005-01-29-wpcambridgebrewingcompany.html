<p>I got to have a little taste and treat at the Cambridge Brewing Company while visiting Boston, Mass. I highly recommend their amber:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Cambridge Amber</h2><br />
Well balanced, medium-bodied, with a deep amber-red color, its complex palate covers all the bases. A malty caramel sweetness is followed by notes of chocolates and a dry, slightly roasty finish, complimented by a touch of fruity spicy hops. Brewed with American pale malt, U.S and British caramel, chocolate, and roasted malts, and a blend of Willamette, Galena, and Centennial hops.<br />
OG: 1.048   FG:1.012  ABV: 4.7%<br />
</blockquote></p>
