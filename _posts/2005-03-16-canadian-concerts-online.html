<p>Bell Sympatico in the great <del>state</del> country of Canad<del>i</del>a have put up a <a href='http://speed.sympatico.ca/msn/startcast/music/concerttour/index.html#'>slew of concerts that can be viewed streaming, online</a>. Of course, this includes  the very excellent <a href='http://www.greatbigsea.com/'>Great Big Sea</a>, which is a Newfoundland Canada group playing a rock/celtic music.  They had a great concert in Royal Oak, Michigan last year that I got to see them at. </p>
<p>Streaming concerts, especially after the fact, seems like a great marketing ploy. As I consider going to a band's concert, or even checking out their music, a concert is an excellent chance to see them perform, but in this case without the $50 upfront cost. It will never replace going to a real (good) concert, or stop me from buying an album that has been laid out and I can easily take with me on my iPod.</p>
<p>You'll also find <a href='http://www.thecure.com/'>The Cure</a>, <a href='http://www.thekillers.co.uk/'>The Killers</a>, and <a href='http://www.blackeyedpeas.com/'>Black Eyed Peas</a>. </p>
