<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/11/backseat_playground.html">Brady on O'Reilly Radar</a> posted about <a href="http://www.tii.se/mobility/BSP/index.htm">Backseat Playground</a>, a geolocation based game that tracks the location of a car and gives clues along the way for various mysteries and puzzles. (originally via <a href="http://feeds.engadget.com/~r/weblogsinc/engadget/~3/54655696/">Engadet</a> who found it via <a href="http://www.therawfeed.com/2006/11/in-car-vr-gaming-uses-gps-calls-your.html">The Raw Feed</a>)</p>
<p>The research is sponsored by Microsoft and the Ordinance Survey, obviously both very large organizations that want to find commercial uses for their data/services. </p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.comeoutandplay.org">Come Out & Play</a> festival, geolocation games can become much more common as devices come with Geolocation technology built-in, whether it be by GPS, WiFi, Cell, or whatever. </p>
<p>Are geolocated games the cure for the modern sloth of gaming? The Nintendo Wii already has gamers <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/11/13" title="Penny Arcade: You Know It To Be True">bowling in their living rooms</a>. </p>
<p>Now if you can create great platforms for people to easily develop their own games, say by making waypoint, boundaries, rules, targets, objectives. And possibly use Splines/Blogjects to leave as markers, treasure, icons, etc. that users would carry around, pass off, leave, find, etc. Just wrap a nice story around it: buried treasure, Trouble with Tribbles, Pac-Man, Hunt the Wumpus etc. Really, you could probably take any old-skool game and make it into a really great geolocation game.</p>
