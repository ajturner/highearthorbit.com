<p>Did you realize that this week is <a href="http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/education/gaw/about.html" title="Geography Awareness Week 2000 @ nationalgeographic.com">Geography Awareness Week</a>? It began in 1987 to celebrate the importance of geography in our lives. Yay for silly 'holidays'.</p>
<p>Make sure and hug a Neogeographer!</p>
