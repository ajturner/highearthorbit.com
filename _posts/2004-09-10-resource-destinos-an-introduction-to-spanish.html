<p>I saw a very good review at <a href='http://www.kk.org/cooltools/'>Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools</a> about 2 language course: <a href="http://www.learner.org/resources/series75.html">Resource: Destinos: An Introduction to Spanish</a> and <a href='http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html'>French in Action</a>. Both of which are available as online videos!</p>
<p>Also mentioned was <a href='http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com/'>The Thorn Tree</a> a discussion forum about travel around the world.</p>
<p>I'm feeling a definite travel bug and want to go, go, go!</p>
