  content: "Hi Martin.\r\n\r\nYep, we put the link up yesterday morning, but it \"officially\"
    gets all announced today...including a \"developer challenge\" our marketing guy
    Ian Pilling has dreamed up :) (hint, hint)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy the API, and
    weee! my name is in the Blogosphere! \r\n\r\nthanks\r\nAnt"

  content: "a friend of mine and I have been working on a concept that we're calling
    \"pervasive geolocation\", using the WiFi AP locations to calculate in pseudo-realtime
    the location of your WiFi device.  with the help of a bunch of friends we've been
    mapping the US, especially the Mid Atlantic cities, but also places like Phoenix,
    Tuscon, Tampa etc....\r\n\r\nyou hand us an ssid/mac and we'll tell you where
    it is located\r\n\r\nthe programing doc and server info is at http://www.wheresolutions.com/developers\r\n\r\nshould
    qualify as an interesting mashup for tim someday"

  content: "Very nice Marty. How does it differ from <a href='http://www.loki.com/'>Loki</a>?
    Of course, they claim\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLoki is the first application to combine
    the physical with the digital to make the Internet a truly personal and local
    experience. We let you harness the World Wide Web by automatically identifying
    your exact physical location and then making the web revolve around you.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nQuite
    a bold statement. I'm dubious they are the \"first\"."

  content: Well, here is an example of how it can be used - at least how I use it
    - and my visitors like it :)http://www.funandsafedriving.com/ddirections.html

<p>I wish I could attend more conferences on geeky tech stuff - but being in the Midwest, and primarily just a hobbyist on cutting-edge tech stuff, I can't go to all the <em>kewl kidz</em> conferences. I still troll the session lists and try to grab presentations and papers when they're available, which is far-too-little for the O'Reilly confernences.</p>
<p>While drooling over the upcoming O'Reilly Emerging Tech conference I noticed the session: <a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8516'>Building More Useful Mashups: Integrated Routing and Geocoding </a> talk being given by Antony Pegg of MapQuest. However, searches turned up no such API. I guess this API will be announced and released as part of the ETech '06 conference. </p>
<p>The synopsis looks really interesting. Especially since it will offer truly supported routing and geocoding, rather than the current method of using unsupported features of the other major mapping API's.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Free mapping APIs unleashed the creativity of the developer community by allowing anyone to display data on a map. However, existing APIs haven't given developers a complete tool kit.   MapQuest&acirc;&euro;&trade;s OpenAPI is the first to offer integrated routing and geocoding and we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll showcase how you can use these capabilities to build more useful web mashups.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The name "OpenAPI" is obviously a to distinguish this new service from their from their current <a href='http://company.mapquest.com/mqbs/4.html'>AdvantageAPI</a> or <a href='http://company.mapquest.com/mqbs/7.html'>GeographicCoverage</a> POI database, both of which are commercial licensed interfaces to the MapQuest data. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> May 16, 2006 - just an update for anyone that finds this blog entry. The MapQuest OpenAPI is a pretty slick set of interfaces for putting up maps, and most importantly <em>routes</em> in a page or application. I've submitted several competition entries, some of which include the <a href='http://code.highearthorbit.com/greaseroute/'>GreaseRoute</a> mapping scripts for showing routes and locations of Microformat enabled addresses, and <a href='http://code.highearthorbit.com/greaseroute/mapthis.php'>MapThis</a> which hijacks the GMail "MapThis!" link that shows up when an email has an address.</p>
<p>There is another mashup that is currently in beta testing with users. Let me know if you're interested in trying it out.</p>
