<p>I recently read someone make the bet that there will be GPS-enabled powerbooks before G5-powerbooks. I would agree. Moreover, here are some <a href='http://www.kottke.org/05/04/future-spotlight'>example uses for spotlight</a> that include how such functionality would be really useful for archiving/searching for files. In their example, he poses your powerbook would know both when, and <em>where</em> you wrote/received documents. You could search for "presentations written in Omaha", or even locations "photos taken at home".</p>
<p>Of course, this functionality is available immediately. One could have a cumbersome plug-in GPS received, or even better, a bluetooth GPS receiver that is constantly tracking your laptop (well the receiver's) position. When a line-of-sight to the sky isn't available, the meta-information could contain the wireless access point name the laptop was connected to when the file was written, or even use geolocation-by-IP-address. :)</p>
