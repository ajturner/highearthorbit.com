<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-screen_tease.jpg' alt='Screen Tease' align='right' hspace='5px'/>I've recently put together a web-application and am looking for beta testers. Instead of doing the <a href='http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/'>super-private sign-up here and we'll maybe let you in</a> beta testing, I'm doing the "you came across/read this blog so may be interested in trying out a cool app" signup.</p>
<p>Think Calendar and Traveling. </p>
<p>If you're interested, and actively use (or will start  using) GoogleCalendar, or an iCal program like Appl iCal, Sunbird, AOL Calendar, et al. then drop me an email at: <a href='mailto:testing@highearthorbit.com'>testing@highearthorbit.com</a> and I'll let you in on the info.</p>
<p>The idea is I want to test with a small number of "cutting edge" users before releasing it public. It's easier to fix bugs and answer support requests that way. :)</p>
