<p>As a programmer, engineer, and mildly obsessive compulsive, I peruse such sites as <a href='http://www.43folders.com/ '>43 Folders</a>, <a href='http://www.douglasjohnston.net/weblog/index.php/archives/2004/12/09/diy-gtd-08/'>DIY GTD Planner</a>, and other life-hacking kind of fare.</p>
<p>While these are all very cool, I just came across what is probably the most life-changing 'hack' to date, how to fold a T-Shirt in 2-seconds. The aptly named <a href='http://www.fold-your-shirt.com/'>fold-your-shirt.com</a> shows you how to do just that. I currently employ the <a href=''>Zeno's School of Folding</a> in which I continually fold my shirt in halves (until it disappears). This 'new' method is actually incredibly easy to try. </p>
<p>This folding takes 5-10 seconds at least per shirt. Considering a load of laundry has approximately 20 shirts (both the 'T' type and 'polo' variety), we're talking about a 3-8 second savings per shirt for a total of 1-2.6 minute time savings. </p>
<p>Now I do laundry about once every other week, so that is 20 wash days (figure I get 1 wash at home during holidays) per year, 20-53.3 minutes per year. Over the 20 years I've been doing laundry (my momma got me workin' young), that's 6.66-17.76 hours I've lost (not including doing family's laundry). </p>
<p>Now that's a trick worth learning.</p>
