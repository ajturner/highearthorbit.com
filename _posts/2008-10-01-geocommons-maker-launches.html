  content: "Andrew,\r\nI did a lightning review for the Society of Cartographers Newsletter
    (http://www.soc.org.uk/newslett.htm#latestNewsletter) and have a couple
    of supplementary comments below. If there are any inaccuracies feel free to comment
    as it may be carried in expanded version in the SoC Bulletin.\r\nIn a map produced
    subsequently I wanted to show a bi-polar colour scale for values above and below
    zero (ie + and -) for point symbols but couldn't seem to do that. It would be
    really useful to have that option. I ended up putting the data on two layers,
    instead of combining them into a new scale from 5 to -5.\r\nSecondly, when I saved
    the map for public showing it reversed the order of the two layers I had set up,
    so that the graphic effect wasn't exactly as I had wished.\r\nThe relevant map
    is at: \r\nhttp://maker.geocommons.com/maps/1793\r\n\r\nSTEVE"

  content: "Hi Steve - thanks for the feedback, it's very appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the bug with the reversed layer order. That's fixed and will be up on GeoCommons
    public site *very* soon.\r\n\r\nThe Bi-polar divergent scheme for point geometries
    is a little farther out - but we've run into the same issues in making our own
    maps. Our solution has been the same - create two layers - but that's not ideal.
    We're working on a slew of new visualizations that will address this.\r\n\r\nWe
    also have a public forum at http://getsatisfaction.com/geocommons
    if you have thoughts or ideas!"

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2008/10/geocommons-logo.jpg" width="278" height="65" alt="GeoCommons Logo" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" />I'm excited to finally post about the launch of <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons - Visual Analytics through Maps">GeoCommons</a> newest application, <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">Maker<em>!</em></a>. It has been awhile in the making and the team is proud of what we've created.</p>
<p>The goal of Maker is to push the boundaries of web mapping to provide easy to use and powerful cartographic design tools along with access to a huge amount of complex geospatial data. We've integrated Maker into <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons Finder!">Finder!</a>, so any interesting or datasets can be immediately dropped into a map, customized and styled.</p>
<h3>Geographic Visualization</h3></p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion on the differences in viewpoints of mapping from traditional geographers and cartographers when faced with Where2.0 tools. In general, map applications have done a lot of work creating digital versions of physical maps and also throwing hundreds of markers onto a slippy map. But that was just the beginning. We worked with <a href="http://www.axismaps.com/" title="Axis Maps LLC - Cartography. Visualization. Design.">AxisMaps</a> to create an understandable and accurate cartographic design interface. Hopefully the result is a more versed public in the proper use of map design as well as push traditional experts into considering new possibilities.</p>

<br /></p>
<p>Current map interface are quite limited in their ability to display large and interactive data sets. It is getting better with better Javascript engines, so there is a future - but current implementations cope by rendering static image overlays. The result are often non-interactive or explorable maps. This was the reason to use Flash as the map engine in <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">Maker!</a>. It's used solely for map rendering - and not overdone as can happen in many "Flash applications". The data and metadata is fully available as parsable, findable, open formats.</p>
<h3>Pushing KML</h3></p>
<p>Another key aspect of the openness of <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons - Visual Analytics through Maps">GeoCommons</a> is the key feature to export your maps as styled KML. This means you can build up a rich cartographic visualization, export to KML and open in something like <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth">GoogleEarth</a> or WorldWind and retain the styling. This was a goal of the OGC OWS-5 testbed that I <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/kml-3-kick-off-module-styling/" title="KML 3 Kick-off, Module: Styling :: High Earth Orbit">wrote about</a> quite extensively. The styling is actually sort of difficult due to the design of KML itself. In the future, it would be quite nice to have better handling of rules or cascading styling that also <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/kml-3-kick-off-module-metadata/" title="KML 3 Kick-off, Module: Metadata :: High Earth Orbit">linked to attributes</a> in <code>ExtendedData</code>.</p>
<p style=""><a href="/assets/uploads/2008/10/google-earth.jpg"><img src="/assets/uploads/2008/10/google-earth-tm.jpg" width="271" height="187" alt="Google Earth.jpg" style=" padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a></p><br />
<br/></p>
<h3>A step in the right direction</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">Maker!</a> is really meant to push what is possible in Where2.0 - but it's just the beginning. It is a great geographic visualization and interrogation tool, but we have much more planned. When <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/mapufacture-joins-with-fortiusone/" title="Mapufacture joins with FortiusOne :: High Earth Orbit">Mapufacture joined with FortiusOne</a> this summer, I talked about the potential of combining the whole range of data from complex and authoritative to dynamic and personalized. The maps and data should be accessible via a variety of interfaces, annotatable, analyzable, and more.</p>
<p>Please give <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">Maker!</a> a try - and let me know what you think. Even better, send me some of your maps - I'd love to feature some. I'll be sharing mine on my <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/users/ajturner/maps" title="Ajturner's Maps at GeoCommons Maker!">GeoCommons profile</a>.</p>
