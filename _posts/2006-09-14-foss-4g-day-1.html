<p>Really it's day 3 of the <a href='http://foss4g2006.org' title='FOSS4G Homepage'>Free and Open Source Software for Geoinformatics</a>, but today is the first day of presentations. The previous days were workshops and meetings. </p>
<h2>GeoBliki</h2><br />
This morning, <a href='http://vightel.com' title='Vightel Corporation' rel='met'>Pat Cappelaere</a> demonstrated <a href='http://geobliki.org' title='GeoBliki Homepage'>GeoBliki</a>, an effort to aggregate and publish the EO-1 (Earth Orbserver) satellite imagery and sensor data using <a href='http://georss.org' title='GeoRSS Homepage'>GeoRSS</a>, Wiki pages, a Blog, Chat notifications, and a bunch of other cool tools. What is great is seeing all of this valuable, informative data coming from NASA satellites being easily accessible and disseminating to interested researchers and the public. </p>
<p>The <a href='http://geobliki.org' title='GeoBliki Homepage'>GeoBliki</a> publication system is a great use of a sensor web to publish location information connected to sensor data. </p>

<h2>MapChat</h2><br />
The next presentation was by Michael Leahy who is working at the University of Waterloo to develop <a href='http://fesdss08.uwaterloo.ca/mapchat' title='MapChat Alpha interface'>MapChat</a>. MapChat is an online, realtime chat tool for discussing maps, and geographic materials. Users can share map views, highlight and comment areas, and directly work through discussions and issues by working with the actual map data. </p>
<p>Abstract & Materials: <a href='http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=87&sessionId=45&confId=1' title='Implementation of Synchronous, Spatially-Referenced Discussions Between Multiple Users with Open-Source Web GIS and Database Tools'>Implementation of Synchronous, Spatially-Referenced Discussions Between Multiple Users with Open-Source Web GIS and Database Tools</a></p>
<h2>Geospatial Server Appliance</h2><br />
<a href='http://www.eogeo.org/Members/adoyle' title="Allan Doyle's EoGeo homepage" rel="met">Allan Doyle</a>, from MIT and fellow <a href="http://georss.org/blog" title="GeoRSS Blog">GeoRSS blogger</a>, presented some excellent work on creating a Mac-mini computer preloaded with Geospatial tools and data that can be given to NGO's and groups to quickly get up and running without being Geo-experts. By prepackaging the software, and various sets of scripts, users can just plug in the 'appliance' into power and their network and get instant access to maps, geospatial wikis, and analysis tools. </p>
<p><a href='http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/unixport' title='KyngChaos'>KyngChaos</a> is a full set of ported Geo-tools that one can use to quickly get up and running with geo on a Mac/Unix machine.</p>
<p>Abstract & Materials: <a href='http://www.foss4g2006.org/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=99&sessionId=41&confId=1' title='How to fit 5 Kilos of Software into a 1.3 Kilo Box'>How to fit 5 Kilos of Software into a 1.3 Kilo Box</a></p>
<h2>GRASS LEED</h2><br />
Right now, I'm learning about how <a href='http://grass.itc.it' title='GRASS GIS Homepage'>GRASS</a> can be used in Sustainable development and analysis, specifically when applied to <a href='http://www.usgbc.org/LEED' title='USGBC LEED Homepage'>LEED certification</a> (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). Helena Mitasova is proposing means to get Open-Source Geospatial tools adopted into the upcoming LEED-ND for modeling and verification of sites meeting certificate requirements. </p>
<p>GRASS tools support Environmental Preservation, Resource Efficiency such as solar radiation modeling and photovoltaic potential of locations. Imagine using something like Univ. of Waterloo's MapChat to gather environmentalists, planners, administrators, and possibly the public to discuss and present various environmental anayses. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears that geospatial tools, especially open-source tools, are not properly introduced and taught to University students who could really use these tools to do effective research and analysis. </p>

<p>More updates soon...</p>
