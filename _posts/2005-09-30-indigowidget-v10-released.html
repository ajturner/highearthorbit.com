<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/software/indigowidget'>IndigoWidget</a> is a <a href='http://apple.com/dashboard'>Dashboard widget</a> for controlling <a href='http://perceptiveautomation.com'>Indigo Home Automation</a> software. <img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/IndigoWidget_Devices.png' alt='IndigoWidget Devices' hspace='10px' vspace='10px' height='150px' align='right'/></p>
<p>Home automation is great. Perhaps not necessary (ok, definitely not <em>necessary</em>) but I've always gotten a big kick out of writing software that makes things in the world turn on, move, shake, blow up, or otherwise do something real. It's like magic to me, even when I wrote the code and understand all (most) of the physics behind it.</p>
<p>Now you can control your lamp sitting on your desk just by hitting <em>F12</em> and then flipping the switch or sliding the slider! Well, ok, better example - turn off all the lights outside before you go to bed. Or, get that fresh pot of coffee brewing, straight from your dashboard!<br />
The project is free of charge, and open-source (well, like most widgets - but this is actually open-source <em>licensed</em>). So have a go!</p>
