<p><a href='http://www.cellspotting.com/webpages/cellspotting.html'>Cellspotting</a> is a form of geolocation using your cellphone and known cell-locations in a database. Unfortunately, it appears to require users to create a maintain a database of cell-locations rather than using built-in GPS or current location-based cell technologies.
