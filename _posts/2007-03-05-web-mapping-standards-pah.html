<p>Marc at <a href="http://geonames.org/" title="Geonames">Geonames</a> <a href="http://geonames.wordpress.com/2007/03/04/web-map-api-standard/" title="Web Map API Standard">points out</a> that Google has a request for feature requests their mapping API. He supports the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Compatibility with other map APIs&acirc;&euro;&tilde;.</p>
<p>I disagree. If a mapping API vendor is required to (or tries to) stay within an agreed upon 'standard' API, then that could stifle features/innovation. They would have to all agree on a standard to, say, add polygonal overlays, or moving objects (e.g. tracking realtime position of other vehicles) </p>
<p>However, when this 'abstraction of API' is relegated to other projects (as he points out <a href="http://mapstraction.com" title="Mapstraction" rel="me">Mapstraction</a>, <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>, and <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/lightlang/197003355">MyMap</a> <b>do this</b>, they don't just attempt it) then each of them can decide if they are a minimal set implementation (only allow what all allow), or a maximum set, or somewhere in between. </p>
<p>What is better if they just support mapping using data format standards. They should all consume open/non-partisan standards such as <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX</a>, <a href="http://georss.org">GeoRSS</a>, <a href="http://www.opengis.net/gml/">GML</a>, etc. That way someone doesn't necessarily need to know the entire API if they can just load and map their common data source. </p>
<p>Is there a way to vote for the anti-request. :)</p>
