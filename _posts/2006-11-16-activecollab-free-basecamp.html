    I have no problem paying for a great service instead of just using one because
    it's free. \r\n\r\nBut to each his own."

<p><a href="http://www.activecollab.com/" title="ActiveCollab Homepage">activeCollab</a> is an easy to use, web based, open source collaboration and project management tool. It's <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" title="BaseCamp">BaseCamp</a>, but free of charge and open-source. And I actually possess all of my own data. </p>
<p>Setup took a whopping 10 minutes (including waiting for the DNS of the MySQL database to propagate, and adding some accounts). You can setup projects, add users, limit users to specific projects, and add clients. It even <strong>looks</strong> really great, which is entirely not-normal for an Open-Source project, which is usually very innovative/solid, but looks like old white toast. </p>
<p>I don't think it supports the nice API's and such that BaseCamp does, but it's an actively developed project, so hopefully it shows up soon.</p>
