<p>Well, between yesterday and today, GoogleMaps has changed their interface. This has broken <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/location/'>my Travelogue</a> as well as the post map in the right-sidebar of my site. </p>
<p>As evidenced by <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> and other sites, providing developers and enthusiasts a public interface to your tools is both great for ideas, development, and advertising. I used <a href='http://maps.google.com'>GoogleMaps </a>more because I can fool around with it in my own stuff, for much the same reason I started using <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> over Snapfish or the other photo sharing sites.</p>
<p>But with Google sticking to the "Beta" moniker, they allow a gateway for themselves to change the API, and other functionality willy-nilly with no warning, or support for prior versions. Obviously they are actively developing and updating (the map-satellite icons are different on the <a href='http://maps.google.com'>maps.google.com</a> page) but it reminds me that Google is a company who is interested first, and foremost, in the company and it's money. Of course, being publicly traded, this is reinforced now by stockholder's interests. </p>
<p>Google is doing a similar thing by attempting to restrict GreaseMonkey scripts from operating in Gmail.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the great article about how <a href='http://apple.com'>another fruit company</a> that has a beloved community has moved from <a href='http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/03/apple_becomes_a.html'>"we company" to a "they company"</a>.</p>
