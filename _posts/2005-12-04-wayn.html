They have done some nice things like included AIM, MSN, Outlook, Yahoo integration for contacts (<strong>beware!</strong> WAYN <em>will</em> contact those people in your contacts that are not currently members), and has a built-in chat client with location abilities. </p>
<p>All these location services popping up. Seems like a new kind of IM 'war', where your friends are on one service and you are on another service. There will have to be Adium/GAIM/Trillian clients in which you can upload your location/travels once to all of the services.</p>
