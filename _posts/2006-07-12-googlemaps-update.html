<p>Did I miss the news somewhere that GoogleMaps got a big UI update? </p>
<p>The largest noticeable difference is that when you "zoom" it's first just increases the resolution size of the current layer of tiles, and then replaces them with the actual higher-resolution (new) tiles as they come back from the server. The effect is a kind of disjointed 'popping'. I like the idea that the zooming is better, but I don't think they should zoom the text - which makes the popping more apparent.</p>
<p>There are other little flavorings are Web2.0-boxing of the 'Search the map | Find businesses | Get directions' tabs.</p>
<p>Ahh, I see there was a <a href='http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2006/07/zoooooooom.html'>GoogleMaps Blog post</a> titled, appropriately "Zoooooooom!". </p>
