  content: "What's interesting at smugmug is the ability (at the pro/$99 level)
    to order photos in a variety of formats. As the photographer, you can set the
    markup on the photos, and pocket a goodly portion of it. \r\n\r\nNot that i'm
    looking to offset college costs or anything.\r\n\r\nThey are certainly popular
    with the 'Petnax' folks over at dpreview.\r\n\r\n"

  content: "In general smugMugs seems to be a little sleeker due to the fact that
    all members must be paying members. It is a low entry fee, but restricts usage
    to people who are more invested in making it a community. \r\n\r\nAnd those 'Petnax'
    folks are a crazy bunch!"

<p>I've never heard of <a href='http://smugmug.com'>smugMug</a> before, or if I have it was in a caffeine-induced frenzy of web-browsing. I probably said, "Oh, neat, another photo-sharing site" and moved on. However, based on the recent <a href='http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,68654,00.html'>fracas</a> regarding Flickr requiring Yahoo! accounts and the possible integration of <em>Yahoo-nes</em> to the otherwise clean & functional flickr interface, smugMug looks like a nice option. </p>
<p>However, I recently came across their GoogleMaps integration, <a href='http://maps.smugmug.com/'>smugMaps</a>. It's very much like <a href='http://geobloggers.com'>geobloggers</a>, except geobloggers seems to have gone off the deep-end on functionality, widgets, and whatnot. They even describe (though with much detail left out), how to <a href='http://www.smugmug.com/hack/maps-overview'>mix-up your own geo-tagged smugMug images</a>. </p>
<p>Reading the "about us" page on <a href='http://smugmug.com'>smugMug</a> makes me think the site should be called "smugInternetBarons", but I digress. Their self-touted wealth may prevent them from 'cashing in' later to some company like Yahoo! (or MSN) and instead just continue as an independent, fun photo-sharing service.</p>
