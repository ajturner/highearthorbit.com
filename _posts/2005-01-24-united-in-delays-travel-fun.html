<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/UnclaimedBaggage.jpg' align='right'>Having your flight delayed by <str>4 hours</str> when the skies are blue just because there isn't an airplane outside your gate can be rather annoying. Now, tack on to that the fact that they <str>removed 50 bags of luggage</str> before taking off, and you can imagine the whole plane was as fun as a bag full of badgers. </p>
<p>Of course, they didn't tell anyone that right away. No, it was kind of a self-realization: "hm... this baggage carousel said our flight, I think I saw <em>a</em> bag come out, and now it's another flight on the board..." </p>
<p>So, I get to wear the same outfit at least twice in two days (yummy). Fortunately, being the geek I am, I had all the 'essentials' (laptop, camera, usb harddrive, ipod, work docs, et. al.) in my carry-on and just relegated such lowly items as: deodorant, socks, pants, to the bag which faced the freezing cold of the plane underbelly. </p>
<p>On the up side, I get to go play in the snow of the Army's Cold Regions Laboratory today. </p>
<p><em>Update:</em><br />
I *finally got a call <strong>2 days later</strong> that United had found my luggage (poor luggage, lost in the cold) and would end up shipping it back to Detroit. So, bonus, I get to wear the same set of clothing (with some borrowings from a lithe <a href='http://doubledot.net/wordpress'>Troy of DoubleDot.net</a>) for nigh on these 4 days. </p>
<blockquote><p>W00t! I say, W00t!</blockquote></p>
<p>And now I sit in the Boston Logan Airport. Guess what? My flight home was <strong>canceled</strong>. I guess I really shouldn't be suprised. I will now be getting home 3 hours later than normal (better than the 5 hours late coming) but the end result is the same. I'm tired, stinky, and have missed many days of work. Oh the toil.</p>
