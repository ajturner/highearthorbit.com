    earthquake in Haiti is one of the word disasters this year. I just hope that they

The analysis team at FortiusOne has put together a <a href="http://news.geocommons.com/haitiquake" title="Haiti Earthquake Relief Maps">news dashboard</a> highlighting the event and current response efforts.</p>
<p>There have been several tremendous groups that have actively been contributing data and tools both with remote developers and responders on the ground. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/crisismappers">CrisisMappers</a>, <a href="http://haiti.crisiscommons.org/" title="CrisisCommons::Haiti">CrisisCommons</a>, <a href="http://sitroom.ushahididev.com/" title="Ushahidi Situation Room">Ushahidi</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti" title="WikiProject Haiti - OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Many data providers have been making their data freely available. This is most notable when looking at <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/2010/01/14/1518" title="Brain Off &Acirc;&raquo; Haiti OpenStreetMap Response :: Mikel Maron :: Building Digital Technology for Our Planet">Mikel's screenshots of OpenStreetMap</a> before the quake and after volunteers began tracing over historic maps and newer satellite imagery from Digital Globe and GeoEye.</p>
