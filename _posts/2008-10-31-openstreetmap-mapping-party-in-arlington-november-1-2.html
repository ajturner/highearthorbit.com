<p>It's just about here - we're hosting the first Washington, DC area mapping party this weekend at the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcal" title="hcalendar - Microformats">FortiusOne</a> office in Arlington. You can also meet the GeoCommons team!</p>
<p>If you haven't been to a mapping party - essentially anyone can show up throughout the day, borrow a GPS unit (or bring your own), get a quick tutorial on how to collect data for <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> and then head out for a gorgeous day around the town gathering tracks, points of interest, road data, bike trails, walking areas, etc. It's a great way to explore the city and also make maps that are useful to you! While the OSM map for Arlington and DC "looks" fairly complete it's missing a lot of useful information such as directions, metros and more - so it still needs a lot of TLC.</p>
<p>Once you get back with your data we can show you how to upload it to OpenStreetMap. Of course, there is also typically post-mapping socializing somewhere nearby. Overall the day is very free and you can come for as short as an hour or two - but I'll warn you that it's very addictive.</p>
<p>The event is listed for both Saturday and Sunday - but my recommendation is to come on Sunday. Saturday is <a href="http://barcamp.org/SocialDevCampEast" title="BarCamp wiki / SocialDevCampEast">SocialDevCamp</a> East up in Baltimore, and also on Sunday <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/" title="Brain Off :: Mikel Maron :: Building Digital Technology for Our Planet">Mikel</a> will be in town to provide his mapping expertise to the party.</p>
<p>Here are the event details (in <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcal" title="hcalendar - Microformats">hCal</a> of course).</p>
