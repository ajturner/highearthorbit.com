  content: I purchased the CueCat on ebay for ~$10. It's been working great too! I

<p>So I finally bought, received, and <a href="http://www.flyingbuttmonkeys.com/foocat/usb/">"declawed"</a> my CueCat. It now works extremely well slurping up barcodes from my books and right into this nice <a href="http://books.aetherial.net/">little app, Books</a>.</p>
