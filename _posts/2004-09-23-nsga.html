<p>Have you ever heard of the <a href='http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/index.html'>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</a>? Sounds pretty neat! They have a (updated monthly) full listing of locations around the world as well as their Lat/Lon coordinates. However, it's 200MB! </p>
<p><em>Update</em><br />
So I determined that the NGIA is focused on 'foreign' (with relation to the US) designations, whilst the <a href='http://geonames.usgs.gov/'>USGS GNIS</a> handles US and <em>Antartica</em> ('did he just say Antartica'). Hrm, I wasn't aware Antartica was considered part of 'the Homeland' of the US. Guess the boys in brass have their eyes on getting a certain section of land...</p>
