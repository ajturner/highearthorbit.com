  content: I'm subscribed to the dead-tree version of Make.  A soldering iron is on
    my holiday wish list, and I plan to make the magnetic stripe reader from issue
    1 and the teabag timer from issue 4.  On a slightly related note, I can't wait
    for my <a href="http://www.robotstore.com/catalog/display.asp?pid=747"
    rel="nofollow">tea server robot kit</a> to come!

<p>I've been a subscriber to <a href='http://makezine.com'>Make</a> since it was announced a little over a year ago. I've poured through each article, especially the ones written by <a href='http://makezine.com/pub/au/Johnny_Lee'>friends from college</a>. Several are on my slate to build (one day), since I miss the fun of actual building something <em>physical</em> instead of just all my current <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/project/'>digital projects</a>.</p>
<p>To aid in this (hopefully), I just signed up for <a href='http://www.make-digital.com/'>Make: Digital Edition</a>, which is free for all subscribers. The entire issue is available via a PDF/Zinio type format. Pages are printable, but unfortunately, not selectable. This obviously prevents the easy copyright infringement (be it purposefully or accidental), but also difficult for making private, <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wiki'>digital</a>, <a href='http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/'>notebooks</a>. I also imagine this is because of the typesetting involved for making all of the fonts and graphics.</p>
<p>They also have Issues <a href='http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol01/'>1</a> and <a href='http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol02/'>2</a>, but oddly enough, not <a href='http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol03/'>issue 3</a>. </p>
