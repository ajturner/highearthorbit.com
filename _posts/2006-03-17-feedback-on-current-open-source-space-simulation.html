  content: "I do intend to take a look at that Open-SESSAME project, I promise. :)\r\n\r\nJust
    last week I was listening to a co-worker describe problems he was having on a
    mission where they're seeing some odd behavior from the real-time operating system
    (on the flight hardware) but are really frustrated because it's closed-source."

<p>My paper, titled "The Development and Use of Open Source Spacecraft Simulation and Control Software for Education and Research" has been accepted to the <a href='http://smc-it.jpl.nasa.gov/'>Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology</a> to be presented in at NASA JPL in Pasedena, California this coming July.</p>
<p>It primarily will present the original development as well as current users & users of the <a href='http://spacecraft.sf.net'>Open-SESSAME Framework</a> (Open-Source Spacecraft Simulation And Modeling Environment).</p>
<p>I know there are some space-geeks that check out the blog, I'd like to ask for any comments or feedback you have on the use of open-source software in spacecraft research, simulation, education, operations, and/or analysis. Software packages, experiences, desired features/functionality in software and even open-source hardware. </p>
<p>You can either leave a comment on the site, or email me at <a href='mailto:simulation@highearthorbit.com'>simulation@highearthorbit.com</a>.</p>
