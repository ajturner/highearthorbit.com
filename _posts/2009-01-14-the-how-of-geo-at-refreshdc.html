Especially covering web and mobile based map design, interaction, tools, examples, and use cases.</p>
<p>As part of the talk I'll be showcasing the evolution of user-contributed content via mobile devices from <a href="http://blog.twittervotereport.com/" title="Twitter Vote Report &Acirc;&raquo; Home">VoteReport</a> to the upcoming <a href="http://inaugurationreport.com" title="NPR: Moving Forward With Inauguration Report">InaugurationReport</a> and <a href="http://www.navigatingwashington.com/" title="">NavigatingWashington</a> sites, and how developers and designers can integrate these ideas, and tools into their web applications.</p>
<p>Of course - as I <a href="http://twitter.com/ajturner/statuses/1091645315" title="Twitter / Andrew Turner: January 15 is apparently g ...">mentioned</a> the other day there are 2 other geo-meetups that evening, depending on your flavor of mapping you're looking for:</p>
