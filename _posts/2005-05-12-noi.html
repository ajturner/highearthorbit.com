<p>The local library DVD videos have the nice feature of labeling the outside binding of the case with the country of origin for foreign films (foreign to the US). Actually, they label anything that isn't mainstream - which is a good idea. Lets the 'locals' know to steer clear, because it's 'different', and lets others gravitate to the independent/foreign/off-beat films. So, you can glance across the shelves and see "Swedish" "French" "Silent" "B&W", etc.</p>
<p>Based on the tips of friends and family, we've had an infatuation with the rarely acknowledged country of Iceland. So we were excited when we saw "Icelandic" on one of the labels and quickly snatched it up. We've also had our fill of <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http%3A//www.nowrunning.com/cgi-bin/movies/morningRaga.asp&ei=11ODQr7LG4uEaoz3_JMM' target='_new'>Hindi films</a> for awhile.</p>
<p>The film was N&Atilde;&sup3;i, or "Noi Albino" in the original. It's set in the small village of <a href='www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=66.1632&lon=-23.2904&scale=1000000&icon=x' target='_new'>Bolungarv&Atilde;&OElig;k, Iceland</a> and is a short tale of the awkwardness, development, and tragedy of a boy dealing with the harshness of life in such a village. Overall it's visually stunning (see the <a href='http://www.noi-themovie.com/photos.htm' target='_new'>photos</a>), well written, excellent acting (especially the grandmother) and very interesting. </p>
<p>Visually, the film was made in bleak, stark colors with a touch of graniness. Each character had a unique personality that contributed individually to the movie. It was a small cast, with approximately 6 main characters, all revolving around the central figure Noi. </p>
<p>And as bleak as the life seemed, it really makes me want to visit Iceland more, though perhaps not live there. :)</p>
