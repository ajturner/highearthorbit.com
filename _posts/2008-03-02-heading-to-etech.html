<p>Last minute opportunities made it a good idea to head the <a href="http://conference.oreilly.com/etech" title="Home: ETech 2008  &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; O'Reilly Conferences, 03/03/2008 - 03/06/2008, San Diego, CA">O'Reilly ETech Conference</a> in San Diego. I've wanted to go several times in the past - ETech is an enlightening look into what cutting edge techniques and concepts companies are using - typically outside of the norm. </p>
<p>As my global network of contacts grow, it's always great to meetup with people that I've digitally conversed with often. <a href="http://pictearth.ning.com/profile/ortelius" title="Jeffrey Johnson&#039;s Page - Pict&#039;Earth ... World on Live">Jeffrey Johnson,aka Ortelius</a>, is going to meet up and show off some of his very cool Aerial Imaging with RC Airplanes, part of the <a href="http://openaerialmap.org/" title="A Free View of the World -- OpenAerialMap">Open Aerial Map</a> project. </p>
<p>The first day I'll be sitting in on a part of Marc's Food Hacking Workshop - though this past Thursday I got a very in-depth tutorial on proper cooking concepts and culinary design. </p>
<p>So if you're at the conference, make sure and find me. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader on figuring out how to do that. </p>
