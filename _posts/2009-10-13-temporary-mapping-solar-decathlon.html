  content: "Definitely - though not start_date, that implies that a feature just doesn't
    exist before/after a date. \r\n\r\nWhat you want to look at are the access
    (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access) and time restriction
    (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Time_restricted_tags)
    tags."

  content: "Hey, good work.\r\n\r\nOf course ephemeral is pretty subjective. Looking
    at it from an historical or archaeological perspective pretty much everything
    exists for a relatively short period of time and would naturally have a start_date/end_date
    (or period, or either). \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nA"

<p>This week on the DC National Mall there is the <a href="http://www.solardecathlon.org/" title="U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon Home Page">2009 Solar Decathlon</a>. It's a contest between 20 student groups from around the world that build, on the mall, sustainable, energy efficient, and modern houses. The competition measures their efficiency, quality, resource usage, and design. It's a one week miny village.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.8894799351692&amp;lon=-77.0276382565498&amp;zoom=18" title="View Solar Decathlon in OpenStreetMap"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/OSM_Solar_Decathlon-tm.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="OpenStreetMap Solar Decathlon" style="padding:5px;" /></a></p>
<p>So of course, like any village, it needed to be <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.8894799351692&amp;lon=-77.0276382565498&amp;zoom=18" title="view Solar Decathlon in OpenStreetMap" target="_blank">mapped</a>. I went down Saturday afternoon and captured the locations and names of all the buildings and paths that will be up for the week. These are then loaded into OpenStreetMap with <code>start_date</code> and <code>end_date</code> tags that notify the renderer when the features should be visible. It's a similar model to how Burning Man is mapped year after year as it walks along the Black Rock Desert.</p>
<p>It's ephemeral mapping - objects that exist in real place, but just for small slices of time. Important as any other building, yet typically relegated to flyers or verbal descriptions.</p>
<p>The fascinating part of projects like this is that OpenStreetMap allowed me to create a map that was useful and immediate. Within minutes of uploading the data, it was available as rendered tiles, vector data, and downloadable to GPS units and iPhones. People on the mall could immediately view the local map with this new information.</p>
<p>It's a nice demonstration of how community projects like <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> will continue to innovate faster, and more openly, then <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/page/mapshare" title="TomTom, portable GPS car navigation systems - mapshare">other</a> 'crowd-sourcing' <a href="http://www.google.com/mapmaker" title="Google Map Maker">options</a>.</p>
