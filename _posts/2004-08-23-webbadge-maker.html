<p>For some odd, and perhaps unhealthy reason, I am fascinated with Web-Badges.  Odd since I don't have any posted here yet. That will soon change.<br />
Found a pretty good, online <a href="http://www.kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/">WebBadge Maker</a> that I plan to make use of in odd, and hopefully sometimes useful, ways.</p>
