<p><a href='http://mappr.com/'>Mappr</a> is the location-based 'mod' to Flickr that posts pictures on a map based on location. This is a <strong>great</strong> idea. However, it requires a user include the location in the 'tags', such as city & state or zipcode in their Flickr post. A simple enough means to get the location of your Flickr photos and doesn't require users to upload pictures to yet <em>another</em> server. Unfortunately Mappr doesn't use latitude and longitude coordinates, and is limited to the United States. </p>
<p>There's no reason it <em>has</em> to be restricted to the US, but I guess they're doing a proof of concept first. </p>
