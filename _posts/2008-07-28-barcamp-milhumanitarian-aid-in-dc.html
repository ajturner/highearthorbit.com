<p>I met <a href="http://limnthis.typepad.com/" title="Limn This" rel="met">Jim Stogdill</a> at <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/foocamp-humans-and-machines-get-intimate/" title="FooCamp - humans and machines get intimate :: High Earth Orbit">FooCamp</a> and we had quite a few discussions about the use of new and web technologies in the government, military and other large organizations. He was also carrying a really great Crown Graphic, bellows camera that captured <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jstogdill/tags/foocamp2008/" title="Flickr: lomoeye's stuff tagged with foocamp2008">authentic looking aged photographs</a>, albeit on discontinued and hard to find Polaroid film</p>
<p>He's putting together <span class="vevent"><a class="summary url" href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampMil">BarCampMil</a>, <span class="description">a barcamp for the Defense, IC, Government, and Humanitarian communities.</span> It is on <abbr class="dtstart" title="2008-08-08T08:00:00-0400">August 8th, from 8AM</abbr> until <abbr class="dtend" title="2008-08-08T15:00:00-0400">5PM</abbr> or later at <span class="location">Mercury Federal Systems offices in Crystal City, VA next to the Metro</span>.</span> (via <a href="http://limnthis.typepad.com/limn_this/2008/07/barcamp-mil.html" title="Limn This: Barcamp Mil">Limn This</a>). So if you can be in the DC area next Friday, you should definitely come by.</p>
<p>And really, where's the logo Jim? :)</p>
