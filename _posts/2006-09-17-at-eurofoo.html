<p>Just got to O'Reilly's EuroFOO in Brussels, Belgium. It's a Open-Conference style meeting where anyone and everyone can present. The purpose being to bring together various thinkers/designers/people and connect their ideas and abilities. I've gone to several BarCamps with a similar format, and really think its an excellent means to really get at concepts and build on multi-process/disciplinary synergy. </p>
