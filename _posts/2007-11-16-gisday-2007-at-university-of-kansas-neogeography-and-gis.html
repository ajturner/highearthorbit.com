    I am not the ArcGIS Server Dev lead.  I work on the dev team as a product engineer
    and lead a few of the projects that I showcased.  \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJeremy"

  content: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I missed your Thursday tutorial.  I wasn't
    invited.  I will be able to figure that stuff out on my own, but it always helps
    to get that walk-through in the beginning.  I am a programmer that loves maps.
    \ I started out doing mountain orienteering as a teenager (I could go fast, because
    of my ability to picture the world by looking at the contour lines), and I really
    like my GPS receivers.  I was totally turned off by commercial GIS, because who
    can afford that software just for fun?  You guys presented a really fun-looking
    alternative.\r\n\r\nThe day reminded me of my days as a Comp Sci undergrad.  We
    were so proud of our \"hitting the metal, har, har, har!\" low-level coding.  Industry
    folks kept commenting on graduate's non-preparedness for the workforce at conferences,
    so our professors had us work even harder.  When I finally reached the \"real
    world\" I was completely unprepared.  This was the early nineties and the business
    world was using SQL, OO, and RAD, and we were trained to write operating systems,
    and we worked really-hard learning these \"wrong\" skills, because we really wanted
    to be ready for work.\r\n\r\nYour concerns about the message are reasonable.  I
    was near students and professors (I assume) during the talks, and (at least the
    folks near me) were struggling to understand the first four lectures.  How bad
    was this?  I heard one student (I assume) ask a professor (I assume): \"Did he
    just use the word 'monolithic'? Is that 'one rock'?  'lithic' is 'stone', and
    'mono' is 'one'?\"  Another student was wondering out loud if \"IT\" stood for
    \"Industrial Technology\".  Needless to say that Jeremy's \"it's this simple\"
    message probably wasn't getting through when he put up that JavaScript on the
    screen...\r\n\r\nSo, this reminds me of my own undergrad experience in Comp Sci
    because these folks didn't seem to have the same experiences that the industry
    folks did.  It's one thing to not be a Neo-geographer, but how do you get the
    most of the ESRI software if you don't have SQL and other IT skills?\r\n\r\nI
    thank all of you guys for your time.  I really saw a new future that day.\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\nPaul"

<p>I spent much of Geography Week and <a href="http://www.gis.ku.edu/gisday/2007/" title="GIS@KU: GIS Day 2007">GISDay at the University of Kansas</a> as an invited speaker on 'Neogeography'. I was lucky enough to meet the coordinator, Josh Campbell, at FOSS4G, and invited to join the illustrious group of speakers, including Geoff Zeiss of <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" title="Autodesk - Home Page">Autodesk</a> and Brian Timoney of <a href="http://www.thetimoneygroup.com/" title="The Timoney Group">The Timoney Group</a>. GISDay has often been very technical, or rah-rah ESRI products. Josh had a goal this year to introduce innovations in geospatial technology through use of open-source software and open-standards. Although I will point out that Jeremy Bartley, a member ESRI's ArcGIS Server development team had an impressive demonstration of their new ArcGIS 9.3 and the ability to integrate with web mapping platforms and open-standards.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.specifysoftware.org/Informatics" title="KU Informatics - Welcome to Biodiversity Research Center Informatics!">Aimee Stewart</a> gave a really intriguing presentation on <a href="http://www.lifemapper.org/" title="Lifemapper">LifeMapper</a>, employing OGC interfaces and distributed computing for biodiversity modeling. I'm hoping she'll submit a topic to <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/where_20_2008_c.html" title="Where 2.0 2008 CFP launches">Where2.0 2008</a>. <a href="http://www.kars.ku.edu/about/people/jkastens/jkastens.shtml" title="Kansas Applied Remote Sensing (KARS) Program">Jude Kastens</a>' talk on flood mapping was very pertinent considering recent disasters and very threatening dams in Mosul and Three-Gorges. </p>
<p>My presentation slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/gisday2007-neogeography-and-gis/" title="GISDay2007 -  Neogeography And Gis &raquo; SlideShare">available here</a>. They are slightly condensed, as they re-used some of my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/using-and-enabling-the-emerging-geostack" title="Using and Enabling the Emerging GeoStack &raquo; SlideShare">GeoStack slides from Where2.0</a>, so left them out of this export. My goal was to address the increasing discussion, and questions around "What is Neogeography, and how does it fit with traditional GIS and cartography?". </p>

<p>To this end, and inspired by my visit to the historic maps showcased at the Festival of Maps, I gave a brief history of cartography (as I understand it) and how Neogeography can be viewed as a resurgence in 'colloquial cartography'. I will write more on this later, but I was struck by many similarities between previous mapping efforts of ancient and medieval peoples and neogeography of today. Storytelling, ephemeral location markers, and emergence of new wayfinding schemes have repeated themselves with various rounds of technology and culture. </p>
<p>Based on this contextualing of Neogeography, I then offered a proposed, first draft, definition and illustrated various means by which Neogeography has led the way in providing an understandable, user-centric interface to powerful geospatial technology. This has been most recently, and very powerfully, demonstrated with <a href="http://crschmidt.livejournal.com/" title="crschmidt - Recent Entries">Christopher Schmidt's</a> <a href="http://hypercube.telascience.org/fire/" title="San Diego Wildfires 2007">San Diego Fire map</a> that employed <a href="http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/" title="MODIS Rapid Response System - Gallery">MODIS satellite imagery</a>, LandSat basemap, Flickr images, Google MyMaps documentation from citizens and news agencies, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> roads, and <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/12106/55" title="GISuser.com GIS, GPS, LBS, CAD, mapping news, jobs, software, data, community">PictEarth Aerial images</a>, to provide a usable, up-to-date, accurate, information on the occuring disaster. </p>
<h2>An Evaluation</h2><br />
I was definitely concerned, going into the day, how my message would be received.  I wasn't sure of the audience, but assumed it would consist primarily of Geography Students and Professors, both of whom are typically ensconced in proprietary, 'old-school' solutions. Both because those are the tools they know and have data formatted for, and because they typically don't have to pay for the potentially expensive licenses. And like typical academics, they rarely have to be concerned with general public-facing usage of their software or results. </p>
<p>The presentation went "well", in a I didn't fall over success, but I felt there was some broad understanding but not necessarily a deep connection with what I was saying and trying to convey. I did get follow up from the non-geographers in the room that they found my presentation really enlightening and gave them inspiration and material to start investigating adding geo* to their particular application. This is exactly the kind of person that needs to connect with Geographers and GIS experts. I guess the medium will be 'slippy maps' and 'spinny globes' and more importantly, common open-data standards such as GeoRSS and KML.</p>
<p>On Thursday I gave a 2-hour workshop/tutorial on Neogeography. This was another strange presentation to prepare for. I had to remove a lot of basic material from my slide deck. I could safely assume a Ph.D. Geography student knew what "latitude and longitude" meant, and how projections worked. However, they probably (and in reality didn't) have much experience creating webpages, FTP, or Javascript. My personal goal was for the attendees to walk away knowing how to take the KML files they created from Brian Timoney's tutorial and be able to display them online via Mapstraction or OpenLayers. We had success. </p>
<h2>Two-way street</h2><br />
I really did enjoy the entire trip, simply because I enjoy talking with people and sharing ideas, but also because the exposure to a large group of GIS users was such an enlightening experience. Typically in my previous meetings and conferences I'm either surrounded by other Neogeographer-types or even non-geospatial people. I still think there is a long-way to go to convince GIS users where and how they fit into the new tools, and how Neogeographers have a lot to learn on how to properly, and powerfully, engage geospatial technology.</p>
