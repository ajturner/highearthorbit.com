<p>Scott Adams (of Dilbert fame - the dream of many an engineer to throw off the yoke of the corporate world and write comics for a living) came down with a really exotic condition 18 months ago that caused him to lose his speech only when speaking one-on-one. His speech was fine speaking in a large group (thousands) or by himself. But when he spoke one-on-one, he could only manage a hoarse whisper. This was a <em>permanent</em> condition.</p>
<p>The other day he <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/10/good_news_day.html" title="Dilbert blog: Good News Day">fixed his brain</a> by speaking rhyme. Not only was he able to say the rhyme  using a normal voice, it <em>rewired</em> his brain to now allow him to speak normally!</p>
<p>An excellent example of how really odd and complex the human brain is.</p>
