<p>Back in February of this year we worked with the World Bank, USAID, and CrisisCommons to <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/data-dissemination-to-the-haiti-government/" title="Data Dissemination to the Haiti Government :: High Earth Orbit">deploy a large amount of map imagery and tiles</a> to the Haitian Government and clusters working in relief. We included a forked version of <a href="http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/400/haiti-crisis-map-effort/" title="Technical Ramblings &Acirc;&raquo; Blog Archive &Acirc;&raquo; Haiti Crisis Map Effort">crschmidt's haitibrowser</a> to work <a href="http://github.com/ajturner/haitibrowser" title="ajturner's haitibrowser at master - GitHub">offline on USB sticks</a>.</p>
<p>One of the issues we encountered were the vast amount of pre-rendered tile images that needed to be moved to the device. The overall size was not that large - in the hundreds of megabytes. It was the number of files that caused issues in copying and replicated these USB sticks in order to aid in the proliferation of data.</p>
<p>I've long been an ardent supporter of <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" title="SQLite Home Page">SQLite</a> and <a href="http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/" title="SpatiaLite download page">Spatialite</a> as <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-where-we-are/" title="GeoWeb Standards '&ldquo; Where we are :: High Earth Orbit">Open Data containers</a> for geospatial data. It's a portable, offline, open standard, relational data store that provides great access and compression. About a year ago we even <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2009/12/15/better-know-a-geocommons-feature-spatialite/" title="Better Know a GeoCommons Feature - SpatiaLite | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">added Spatialite support to GeoCommons</a> - so anyone can convert data to a SQLite database.</p>
<p>Almost exactly three years ago, <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/2007/10/19/1271" title="Brain Off &Acirc;&raquo; OpenStreetMap on the iPhone! :: Mikel Maron :: Building Digital Technology for Our Planet">Mikel put OSM on the iPhone</a> after realizing that Apple was using SQLite to store the tile cache for maps. It makes simple sense to put blobs of images inside a table schema for fast storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Development Seed released a command-line toolset called <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/2010/oct/08/portable-map-tiles-format-released" title="Portable Map Tiles Format Released | Development Seed">MBTiles</a> to bundle tiles into SQLite. You can get the <a href="http://github.com/tmcw/mb_tiles_importer" title="tmcw's mb_tiles_importer at master - GitHub">source code here</a>. It's great to finally have the beginnings of a set of tools to better utilize SQLite for storing and sharing tilesets.</p>
<p>Chris Schmidt has <a href="http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/430/mbtiles-a-bit-of-a-rant/" title="Technical Ramblings &Acirc;&raquo; Blog Archive &Acirc;&raquo; MBTiles '&rdquo; a bit of a rant">shared his ideas</a> and added broadening support to TileCache in support of storing tiles in SQLite so that anyone using TileCache can now easily load tiles offline.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see more adoption of easy mechanisms for interchanging data - raster and vector. We have a couple of ideas and things brewing in how to combine these tiles with other vector data as well as rendering that could really provide some good mechanisms for open spatial data stores.</p>
