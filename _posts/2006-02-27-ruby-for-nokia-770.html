  content: Is Ruby only available for ITOS2005 on the Nokia770? How about ITOS2006?
    I would like to run "gpx.rb" directly on the Nokia770 to calculate the distance
    of Maemo-Mapper recorded's tracks.

  content: "Unforunately - as you point out (and I found out recently) Ruby hasn't
    been ported to the ITOS2006 yet. It's on the 'wishlist' - so hopefully soon!\r\n\r\nOf
    course, perhaps it would be better to use a Python script and write some hildon
    widgets for it and make it a proper app. ;)"

(via <a href='http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog'>Maemo Application Catalog</a>)</p>
<p>Of course, I haven't quite figured out what to <em>do</em> with Ruby on the Nokia 770, but its just one of those "oh, cool" things that's worth installing and marveling at how easy it is to get programming when you don't have to worry about binaries, libraries, compiler options, et al.</p>
