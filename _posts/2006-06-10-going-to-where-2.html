<p>So, I'll be making it to the Where 2.0 conference coming up in San Jose, CA, June 13-14. I'm super excited to meet a lot of people I've corresponded with, but haven't had the chance to meet yet. The <a href="'http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/47/program.html'">Where 2.0 program</a> looks really good. Some developers are even <a href="http://www.postneo.com/2006/05/29/where-20-madmen-or-pure-genius" title="GeoRSS Blog">offering various internal organs</a> to go.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="http://www.postneo.com/2006/05/29/where-20-madmen-or-pure-genius" title="Matt Croydon's take">Matt Croydon's take</a> on the 5/15-minute presentation schedule. It seems very "lightning round", but also a really good way to get lots of ideas out and then move the interesting discussion to the sideline and various nightly gatherings.</p>
<p>In particular, the Birds of a Feather (BoF) meetings should be great. There is a <a href="http://microformats.org" title="Microformats wiki">Microformats</a> meeting to discuss the possible directions microformat.  also hope to meet with some of the <a href="http://georss.org" title="GeoRSS ">GeoRSS</a> developers and <a href="http://georss.org/blog" title="GeoRSS Blog">bloggers</a>.</p>
<p>I've even secured a place at the Google Geo Developers day on June 12 - so I should get a chance to show off my <a href="http://whereihadmyfirstkiss.com" title="Where I Had My First Kiss">cool</a> <a href="http://forestimages.org" title="ForestImages Registry Project">mashup</a> projects. Not to mention discussing other possibilities of visualizing geo-specific <a href="http://simcreator.com" title="Realtime Technologies Driving Simulators'">driving simulations</a> in GoogleEarth.</p>
<p>I think my biggest concern about attending is wanting to meet everyone and discuss all the current ideas and possibilities in location information &#38; mapping.</p>
<p>Of course, to get to California, I'm heading out of Vienna early, by way of Detroit, then on to San Francisco. Yay lots of time on a plane. Here's to hoping for flying on something nice like an Airbus 330.</p>
