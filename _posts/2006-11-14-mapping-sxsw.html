<p>Dan Catt announced that <a href="http://geobloggers.com/archives/2006/11/13/sxsw07-mapping-where-the-f-are-we-now/">his panel was accepted at SxSW '07 in March</a>. The title is excellent too: <em>Mapping: Where the F#*% are we now?</em></p>
<p>Mapping, geolocation, and neogeography really is becoming broad and mainstream. This is an example of moving the technology and techniques beyond the geo-geeks, to a broader audience of users and designers. I'm looking forward to hear more about who the panel will include and topics to be covered.</p>
<p><span class="vevent"><a class="url" href="http://2007.sxsw.com/">SxSW, South-by-SouthWest</a>, is a <span class="summary">multimedia festival held each year</span> in  <span class="location">Austin, Texas</span> (<abbr class="dtstart" title="2007-3-09">March 9</abbr>-<abbr class="dtend" title="2007-3-18">18, 2007</abbr>)<span>. I believe it started as a music festival but has greatly expanded into interactive media, especially web, design, art, and now I guess geo. And at $250 for three-days of conference alone, then add in some more for a ton of music, it's a great deal. </p>
