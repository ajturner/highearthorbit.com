<p><em>After having fought off the alien invaders, restored peace to the council, and made it back to the blog, our story continues...</em></p>
<p>BarCamp Chicago was tremendous. It's very difficult to explain or convey the idea behind a BarCamp - but I'll try to do it anyway: "a gathering of people involved in the field of technology, business, users, developers, thinkers, designers, where they are concentrated together for a short period of time to discuss, present, and create their ideas, thoughts, work, and experiences." (sounded better the first time I wrote it, but that's lost to the cobwebs of the digirealm).</p>
<p>See <a href='http://mydigitechnician.blogspot.com/2006/07/recap-reactions-barcamp-chicago-july06.html' title='MyDigitechnician BarCamp Chicago coverage'>myDigitechnician</a> for a good list of the attendees and their associated sites. In general, it was just my kind of venue. I like talking about various ideas in a lot of different areas. I'm an engineer/developer who dabbles in business and design. There were the mirrors of these roles all around the conference, given that they came to the conference with similar mindset. Therefore, it was very easy to have good discussions during presentations,  as well as afterwards or even in the waning hours of the evening, and the waxing hours of the morning (didja like that lunar reference?)</p>
<p>BarCamp, as a structure for conferences, is a very good idea. Unlike other conferences, anyone can present even if they aren't a luminary, well published, write a good abstract, or otherwise pre-planned. (although <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales' title='Jimbo Wales Wiki entry'>some</a> <a href='http://rentzsch.com' title="Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch">are</a> those things). As such an open-conference it promotes the openness of ideas and acceptance. </p>
<p>There was the wonderfully performed presentation by <a href='http://www.sean-johnson.com/' title='Sean Johnson homepage'>Sean Johnson</a> on how to <strong>not</strong> run a business. <a href='http://cleversafe.org' title='CleverSafe homepage'>CleverSafe</a> blew me away with their concept and implementation of a globally distributed, secure, reliable, redundant data storage system (that deserves its own post).  <a href='http://www.stickyfiend.com/' title=''>Ziad Hussain</a> exalted ubiquitous and open devices, and <a href='http://www.walkerhamilton.com/' title='Walker Hamilton homepage'>Walker Hamilton</a> explained that users don't care what community <strong>they're</strong> on, it's where their <strong>friends</strong> are that matters. Add to that a <a href='http://www.gooseisland.com/' title='Goose Island Beer Company'>good IPA</a> and I'm in relative heaven.</p>
<p>My biggest sorrow was that the Detroit Metro area doesn't offer the large <a href='http://www.techsocial.com/' title='Technosocial Venture blog'>number</a> of <a href='http://www.freshwaterventure.com/' title='FreshWaterVenture'>business</a> <a href='http://www.nextchicago.org/' title='Next Chicago: July 25'>resources</a> for <a href='http://techcoffee.com/' title='TechCoffee'>entrepreneurs</a> and <a href='http://www.techcocktail.com/' title='TechCocktail'>tech-types</a>. I'm looking forward to <a href='http://barcamp.org/BarCampGrandRapids'>BarCamp Grand Rapids</a>, which is a <em>little</em> closer to me.</p>
<p>In related news, I need to start using <a href='http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/' title='Ecto Weblog Publishing'>a real blog editing utility</a>, as compared to writing directly in the browser.</p>
