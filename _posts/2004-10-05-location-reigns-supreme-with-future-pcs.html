<p>Engadget had a <a href='http://www.engadget.com/entry/6944052305227141/'>short squirt</a> about how MIT is looking at doing location based services. This article: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118031,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">PCWorld.com - Location Reigns Supreme With Future PCs</a> talks about the 'sensor networks' for <a href='http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/projects/cricket/'>Cricket</a> that seems to require a lot of infrastructure. </p>
<p>Not quite so elegant as doing IP-geolocation. Since everyone is cultivating wireless networks the infrastructure is already in place. With a little better support of the geographic information in DNS entries, Location-based services would be much more achievable in a shorter term.</p>
