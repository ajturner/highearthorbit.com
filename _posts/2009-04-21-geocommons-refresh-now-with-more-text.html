<p>We've been very busy at <a href="http://fortiusone.com">FortiusOne</a> on a number of projects and finally taking a breath to push an update to <a href="http://geocommons.com">GeoCommons.com</a>. They're mostly light refreshing of the front pages. We wanted to highlight both our commercial offerings (did you know you can get GeoCommons in a box?) as well as make it easier to see the benefits and how to use Finder and Maker. Here are a few others I think are worth highlighting:</p>
<h3>Data in, Maps out</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/geocommons-finder.jpg"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/geocommons-finder-tm.jpg" width="300" height="245" alt="GeoCommons Finder!.jpg" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a>Uploading data shouldn't be difficult - so we now have a very easy, tabless uploader that detects the type of data you're trying to upload. So providing a CSV or KML file is easy to just select the file and upload - we'll even pre-populate the metadata using the information we find in the file. Uploading a Shapefile? We help you walk through having to include all the necessary slew of files - and even better, we now support Projections. It's not just a <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/">EPSG:4326</a> world anywmore.</p>
<p>Along with the simplified uploader - you may notice some new neighbors to the familiar old KML, Shapefile, and CSV crew. GeoRSS and Text documents are now accepted uploads to GeoCommons. <a href="http://georss.org/" title="GeoRSS | GeoRSS ::  Geographically Encoded Objects for RSS feeds">GeoRSS</a> clearly makes sense - but text documents?</p>
<p>There is undeniably a large amount of very valuable data, non-georeferenced data, just <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/" title="Main Page - Gutenberg">laying about</a> on the web and computers. We've teamed up with <a href="http://www.metacarta.com/" title="Geographic Search and Referencing Solutions - MetaCarta - At the Forefront of the GeoWeb">MetaCarta</a> to <em>geoparse</em> these text documents and extract locations. For example, check out the CNN article on <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/maps/4637" title="Obama Middle East Talks at GeoCommons Maker!">Obama Middle East Talks</a> or <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/maps/4636" title="War and Peace - Chapter 1 at GeoCommons Maker!">chapter 1 of War and Peace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/us-epa-assessing-outdoor-air-near-schools-at-geocommons-maker-1.jpg"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/us-epa-assessing-outdoor-air-near-schools-at-geocommons-maker-1-tm.jpg" width="300" height="218" alt="US EPA Assessing Outdoor Air Near Schools at GeoCommons Maker!-1.jpg" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a>Another key principle of GeoCommons is that your data should be just as easy to pull out as it is to put in. You can already download styled KML of any map for viewing in Google Earth or in your mashup - but some people just want to put their nice Maker map in a site with no muss or fuss.</p>
<p>So now you can easily embed any GeoCommons map. Just click "Details", and then copy the short HTML and JavaScript snippet, then paste into your blog or site - and voila! A deep, live, interactive map. You can see good examples in the Vancouver Sun's <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/most-ticketed-areas.html" title="Most-ticketed areas - Vancouver Sun">FOIA'd data on ticketed areas</a>, or the Toronto Star's <a href="http://thestar.blogs.com/maps/2009/03/map-of-the-week-bike-accidents.html" title="Map of the Week">1,063 bicycle accident locations in 2008</a>.</p>
<h3>It's about the community</h3></p>
<p>One of the most important features that I consider in this update is linking to our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/geocommons">GetSatisfaction</a> public forums. And look - already a bug filed! I love user feedback. We have a lot of users creating compelling maps and sharing data and want to hear and talk about your suggestions, frustrations, and lessons learned. Have a dataset that you're having some problem cleaning up and uploading? Ask on the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/geocommons/products/geocommons_open_data" title="Recently active topics in GeoCommons about Open Data">Open Data</a> forum and I'm sure someone from the community or our data team can help you out.</p>
<p>Check out the official <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2009/04/21/geocommons-updated-and-our-gc-goes-green-contest/" title="GeoCommons Updated and our 'GC Goes Green&acirc;&euro; Contest | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">Off the Map article</a> for more details. Consider these updates as a light appetizer for some much larger releases we're putting the final glaze on.</p>
