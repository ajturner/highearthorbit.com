<p><a href='http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/buddyspace/'>BuddySpace</a> is a Java application which  allows optional maps for geographical & office-plan visualizations in addition to standard 'buddy lists'". Looks like a really good implementation of locating buddies on maps. This could be the world, a region, or even just an office. This would be great for when you're trying to locate some wandering co-worker, or even find out where a friend is chatting you from.</p>

<p><a href='http://kmi.open.ac.uk/projects/buddyspace/'>BuddySpace</a> is cross-platform and seems like a decently implemented chat client in itself. Being built on Jabber means it will work with <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/ichat.html'>Tiger's iChat</a>.</p>
