  content: Hi Andrew. Also eager to hear the recording. Ask if they have thought about
    how they would redesign the traditional government topographic map (both look
    and feel of map and look and feel of interface to map). Great idea for a panel!

<p>A couple of months ago I post-deadline <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2118" title="2009 SXSW Interactive Panel Picker - Neocartography: Mapping Design and Usability Evolved">submitted a panel suggestion</a> called "Neocartography: Mapping Design and Usability Evolved" to SXSWi and <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/vote-for-the-neocartography-panel-at-sxsw/" title="Vote for the Neocartography Panel at SXSW :: High Earth Orbit">asked for people to help</a> by voting for it. I was notified very late that room was made and the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901302" title="Full Schedule of SXSW Interactive Sessions | SXSW.com">panel got the green light</a>. We had to tweak the panelists and topic somewhat from the original proposal, and thank you to those that helped promote the idea and make it happen.</p>
<p>The goal of the panel is to explain and explore the next generation of mapping tools combined with traditional cartographic techniques to encompass modern capabilities and user expectations. The official description is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Designers are dropping maps into their applications with little concern for usability or design and users are underwhelmed by just another map mashup. We need to move beyond the simple pin-dropping and consider appropriate mapping interfaces. This panel will look at the current and emerging tools to provide compelling geographic interaction and visualization.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<h3>The Panel</h3></p>
<p>The goal was to find panel members that represented different aspects of leading thought behind web map design and usability. A cutting edge artist and designer building industry leading interfaces, a usability expert and lead of the industry changing and most broadly used web mapping platform, and a researcher and formal cartographer bringing traditional techniques to the future. This was quite a daunting task, and am fortunate that just a such a representation was possible to bring to SXSWi:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mike.teczno.com/" title="m. migurski">Mike Migurski</a>, technology lead at <a href="http://www.stamen.com/" title="stamen design | big ideas worth pursuing">Stamen Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/elizabeth/windram" title="Elizabeth Windram - LinkedIn">Elizabeth Windram</a>, User Experience Designer for <a href="http://maps.google.com" title="Google Maps">Maps</a> at <a href="http://google.com" title="Google">Google</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.axismaps.com/personnel.php?id=dave" title="Axis Maps LLC - Cartography. Visualization. Design.">David Heyman</a>, Web Cartographer at <a href="http://www.axismaps.com" title="Axis Maps LLC - Cartography. Visualization. Design.">AxisMaps</a> and lecturer at University of Wisconsin</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Each panelist is an expert in their own right and offers incredible insight, experience and advice. Brought together they can compare ideals, methods, techniques and tools. But with only 60 minutes, what topics to focus on? This is where you can help.</p>
<h3>The Participation</h3></p>
<p>While I have my own ideas of topics to discuss, I would like input from the world on what topics around mapping, cartographic design, and usability are on your minds. Please check out the <a href="http://moderator.appspot.com/#15/e=21766&amp;t=20ba6" title="Google Moderator">Google Moderator</a> topic I created. Create new questions or suggestions, vote pertinent ones up and boring ones down. I'll be using this list to formulate the questions or topics the panel will be discussing.</p>
<h3>The Anticipation</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&amp;id=IAP0901302" title="Full Schedule of SXSW Interactive Sessions | SXSW.com">SXSWi</a> is in just under two weeks - so there isn't much time. Get your suggestions in now. In addition to the <a href="http://moderator.appspot.com/#15/e=21766&amp;t=20ba6" title="Google Moderator">Google Moderator</a> I'll be using Twitter during the panel to accept additional suggestions or topics. And we'll make sure to record the whole thing to share with everyone afterwards.</p>
