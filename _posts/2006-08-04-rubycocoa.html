  content: "Hi JKH - I'm on the RubyCocoa mailing list and have seen the flurry of
    activity. I'll try out the new release when I get a moment.\r\n\r\nI have run
    into a problem where RubyCocoa has prevented me from running ZenTest for Ruby
    on Rails development. Specifically, when I run 'autotest' I get:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nloading
    rspec_rails_autotest\r\n/Library/Frameworks/RubyCocoa.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ruby/osx/objc/oc_import.rb:157:
    [BUG] Bus Error\r\nruby 1.8.5 (2006-12-04) [i686-darwin8.8.2]\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAny
    Ideas?"

<p><a href='http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/' title='RubyCocoa bridge'>RubyCocoa</a> is a bridge between the Mac OS X Cocoa Framework API that makes it callable from Ruby code. You can create applications, objects, call Mac OS X Services. You can even call Applescript:</p>
<pre><code><br />
require 'osx/cocoa'<br />
include OSX<br />
def speak (str)<br />
  str.gsub! (/"/, '\"')<br />
  src = %(say "#{str}")<br />
  NSAppleScript.alloc.initWithSource(src).executeAndReturnError(nil)<br />
end<br />
speak "Hello World!"<br />
speak "Kon nich Wah. Ogan key desu ka?"<br />
</code></pre></p>
<p><a href='http://blog.bleything.ne' title='Ben Bleything blog'>Ben Bleything</a> submitted a talk to RubyConf, titled "<a href='http://blog.bleything.net/pages/harmonize'>Harmonize: Exploiting RubyCocoa and Sync Services for Fun and Profit</a>"  where he discusses making a wrapper around the SyncAPI in Ruby. (<a href='http://blog.bleything.net/articles/2006/08/04/introducing-harmonize' title='blethythingblog: Introducing Harmonize'>blog post introducing Harmonize</a>) </p>
<p><a href='http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/' title='RubyCocoa bridge'>RubyCocoa</a> looks like it may have stagnated a little as the last release was November 2005, but perhaps with such a renewed interest in <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/07/ruby_book_sales_pass_perl.html' title="O'Reilly: Ruby Book Sales Pass Perl ">Ruby</a>, and Mac OS X gaining popularity, perhaps new life with be breathed into it. Projects such as <a href='http://www.syncbridge.com/' title='SyncBridge'>SyncBridge</a> and <a href='http://blog.bleything.net/pages/harmonize' title='Harmonize homepage'>Harmonize</a> also obviously help. </p>
