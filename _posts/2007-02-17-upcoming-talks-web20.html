  content: I ended up at your blog while trying to track down why geopress doesn't
    seem to work in Safari. Although it seems like you have some sort of embedded
    map that is rendering fine for me. Is there a catch I'm not aware of? I've installed
    geopress2.3 with wordpress 2.1

<p>It will give an overview of the new and developing tools that web developers can use to incorporate maps, GeoRSS/KML/Microformats, geocoding, and location in general to their applications or services. </p>
<p>In particular, it is focusing on how to make your application's mapping user-centric, by providing a good user interface, and allowing them to use and share their data and get the data they want onto their devices to use while they're out and about experiencing the world. </p>
