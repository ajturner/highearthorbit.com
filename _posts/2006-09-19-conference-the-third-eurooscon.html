<p>I'm now at my third conference in half-as-many weeks.<br />
EuroOSCON 2006 kicked off today, and the oddest thing so far is the Geo-centric nature of many of the presentations. </p>
<p>Schuyler Earle showed off the MetaCarta Gutenkarte and GeoParsing API's and cool things you can do with historical mapping. <a href="http://www.asklater.com/steve/" title="AskLater blog" rel="met">Steve Coast</a> of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/" title="Adrian Holovaty" rel="met">Adrian Holovaty</a> of Django and <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org" title="Chicago Crime Map">ChicagoCrime Map</a> (and some small, non-mashup called the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/" title="Wall Street Journal">WSJ</a>) talked about producing web maps for journalism and public benefit. </p>
<p>Right now <a href="http://www.davisworld.com" title="Davis World" rel="met">Scott Davis</a> is showing how to <a href="http://www.mapmap.org/ryogm" title="Roll Your Own GoogleMaps">build your own "Slippy Map"</a> (think GoogleMap interface) in 200 lines of Javascript, using your own images, or even higher fidelity <a href="http://opengeospatial.org" title="OGC">OGC services</a>. His demonstration is an excellent tutorial to mapping, tiling, and simple Ajax. Using his example, it would be very easy to build up a House map, a slippy-image viewer, or anything that you need to view a large area in a small window. </p>
<p>What we need to develop is a better Geo-stack:<br />
 Creation -> Aggregation -> Propogation -> Display -> Export </p>
<p>More on that in a follow-up post.</p>
<p><a title="iCalico" href="http://eurooscon06.icalico.org/">iCalico</a> is a really slick RoR application for conference attendees. I create an account and then can select the talks I'm interested in, see who's going, get a schedule, etc. In the future, I hope that with something like a universal ID I can share this information amongst my other data and calendars to embed notes, who I met, get that back and mix it in with my chats &amp; emails. </p>
