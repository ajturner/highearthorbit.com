<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/02/08/skyhook-sirf/">GigaOM is carrying the story about</a> SkyHook's WiFi positioning technology will be integrated into SiRF's next generation GPS chips. </p>
<p>What this means is that hardware devices will be able to use a single solution to get both GPS Satellite positioning as well as WiFi positioning, essentially providing both a clear sky and urban-canyon/indoor positioning solution. </p>
<p>Therefore, these devices will be able to rely on positioning regardless of the visibility of the user to the sky - and provide LBS with a higher reliability. </p>
<p>There's no word on when the first devices (looks like an iRiver media player) will roll out - or what their interface to applications will look like (single "what is my location?" queries?), but whatever it is, it will no doubt be very exciting. </p>
