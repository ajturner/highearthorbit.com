  content: These open source technologies are especially helpful in areas with limited
    resources such as Haiti.  The remapped areas of the devastated areas of Haiti
    will be invaluable as the rebuilding efforts take place.  Keep up the work

<p>Tom and Schuyler are wrapping up their first deploy with the World Bank to Haiti. They've been doing amazing work in connecting the various participants on the ground in sharing data and providing them with lightweight tools and data from the broader web, <a href="http://www.crisismappers.net/">CrisisMappers</a>, and <a href="http://crisiscommons.org" title="CrisisCommons">CrisisCommons</a> community.</p>
<p>Schuyler has been <a href="http://www.iconocla.st/" title="iconocla.st -- a weblog by Schuyler D. Erle">writing up</a> his experiences but due to connectivity and the large amount of work, they've been utilizing Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/schuyler" title="">@schulyer</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/buckley_tom" title="">@buckley_tom</a>, continuing to keep the world up to date on their progress, safety, and insights. They have even managed to get out video discussing the <a href="http://twitter.com/schuyler/status/9201395569" title="">use of OpenStreetMap by UN OCHA</a> and other reconstruction efforts.</p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PyMTKABxaw4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PyMTKABxaw4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344" /><br />

The ability to utilize dynamic information and map interfaces in an offline, or semi-disconnected environment is empowering, while also allowing people to still <em>print</em> their maps with the data. We're now working on deploying these <a href="http://news.geocommons.com/afghanistanelection09">same tools</a> to Afghanistan and other areas that there has been a large amount of data gathered but not broadly distributed.</p>
<p>Tom and Schuyler head back to the U.S. tomorrow, but the job is far from done. Mikel's Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (H.O.T.) is looking to deploy at the end of March to provide continue logistics support and begin training Haitians on building and utilizing the maps - much like the <a href="http://www.mapkibera.org/" title="Map Kibera">MapKibera project</a>. Haiti has perhaps an excellent opportunity to leap-frog the use of open data and technology by empowering the government and people with tools they can use in reconstruction.</p>
<p>The platforms continue to evolve, incorporating lessons learned from user needs, to new data sources, and working in varied environments. We'll continue to provide <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/search?query=haiti" title="">data</a> and <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/search?query=haiti" title="">maps</a> through GeoCommons that are usable by everyone, and distribute tools to anyone who needs them.</p>GEOPRESS_LOCATION(Port-au-Prince, Haiti)</p>
