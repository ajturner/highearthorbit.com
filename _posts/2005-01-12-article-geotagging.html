    wanted to submit a couple corrections..\r\n\r\n* for geotagging RSS with the geo
    namespace, the lat/long doesn't need to be embedded in <geo :point> ... at
    least not for worldkit\r\n* it's Mikel, rather than Michael\r\n\r\n:)</geo>"

  content: "Although it does recall the old camp saw about the 'weather rock' (if
    it's wet, its raining...)\r\nthe Economist did summarize the current state of
    research on micro-forecasts. In addition to discussing some of the true benefits
    (mostly commercial), it also discussed the wisdom of averaging multiple forecasts,
    sort of a Wisdom of Crowds sort of exercise.\r\n\r\nhttp://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2246180"

<p>My second Linux Journal article, titled <a href='http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8025'>Geotagging Web Pages and RSS Feeds</a> was posted yesterday. </p>
<p>It was a little difficult to narrow down the current, commonly used geotagging mechanisms. I'm very excited about the results of the <a href='http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/'>SWAD-E</a> results of their <a href='http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/200410-bud/Overview.html'>Workshop on representing geographic information in the semantic Web</a>. Doing things like FOAF (friend of a friend) relationships with geographic information. Having tooltips that popup showing relative geographic distances between links (e.g. this link is located 4.5km away).</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts on the article.</p>
