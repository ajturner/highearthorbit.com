    \ our relations with China are growing; I would recommend learning Mandarin Chinese.
    \ But, either would be a lot of fun to try out! \r\n\r\nAlso, do we get a report
    card on how successfully you completed last years resolutions? :) "

  content: "I studied Japanese when I lived in Japan for 2 years and it is such a
    fascinating language!  I have no clue how difficult Mandarin Chinese would be
    to learn, but I'm sure it would be beneficial too!  Good luck with your resolutions!

<p>Welcome to 2006, a little late perhaps for some, as I am on the western edge of the day.</p>
<p>I spent a good part of my evening partying it up with a bunch of AARP-types and a very excellent gentleman that happens to be my fianc&Atilde;&copy;'s grand-father. Enroute, after almost a year of "trying to remember", we picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009N9PJA/ref=ase_ruggedeleganc22-20/104-4671742-7191956?s=electronics&v=glance&n=172282&tagActionCode=ruggedeleganc22-20">Olympus WS-100</a> digital voice recorder. The idea being to record all of the great stories, conversations, histories, and lives of our families for archiving, later reviewing and retelling, and other possible "mash-ups". I'll post a better review later, but it seems to work rather well. </p>
<p>A few resolutions for the new year:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install bug-tracking software for my open-source projects</li>
<li><em>finish</em> some of my projects - specifically, lay out a timeline, action items, and milestones and <em>meet them</em> before starting new projects.<br />
</li>
<li>learn another foreign language  - teetering between Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. I really want to learn Japanese but the local course times and a potential future outlook preference Chinese.</li></p>
<li>Plan a <a href="http://wedding.highearthorbit.com">wedding</a></li><br />
</ol></p>
