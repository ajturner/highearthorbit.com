  content: "I read your post.  I read the home page of the software.  And I still
    don't get it.\r\n\r\nDoes it use a better/faster engine than Safari?  I thought
    Safari was based on the KHTML engine."

  content: "Hi Bob, \r\nI added a screenshot to the post. The idea behind Deskpose
    is that it adds a \"slideout\" web browser from the side of your window (think
    hiding dock). By hitting the Cmd-F1 key, the web-browser slides out, I can do
    quick lookups to Google, an online calendar, view my MythTV settings, etc. then
    hit Cmd-F1 and it will slide back away. \r\n\r\nIt makes web applications a quick
    access as a desktop application. For me, though I've only used it a short time,
    its really useful."

<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-DeskbrowseScreenshot.jpg' alt='Deskbrowse Screenshot' align='right' hspace='5px'/><a href='http://deskbrowse.com/' title='Deskpose Homepage'>Deskpose</a> is a really useful application for quickly accessing specific webpages. It's actually a rather full-featured browser, but within *very* easy reach. <cmd>-<f1> in fact. </p>
<p>This is great as another 'dashboard' (don't sue me Apple) for accessing web services, like <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/indigoweb' title='IndigoWeb interface to Indigo'>home automation</a> or <a href='http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythWeb' title='MythWeb interface to MythTV'>television recordings</a>. </p>
<p><a href='http://deskbrowse.com/download' title='Deskpose downloads page'>Get it</a> with all haste. And it's open-source. As they put it very well: "Open like the open roads". Though I don't think I can take home, rearrange, and redistribute the open roads. hrm.... or can I?<br />
