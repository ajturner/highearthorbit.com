<p>/. pointed me to Wired's release of a CD with the next magazine (I hope it comes w/ my issue) of <a href='http://creativecommons.org/wired/'>Creative Common Songs</a>. This includes songs by such good groups as <a href='http://www.mymorningjacket.com/'>My Morning Jacket</a>, whom I recently got introduced to at the MoveOn.org benefit Dave Matthews Band concert at the Palace. </p>
<p>I'm in huge favor of this kind of 'open-sourcing' of creative works. It helps get people involved with creative endeavors without having to know how to play a bunch of instruments/film/photograph. This is similar to the open competition to re-edit and provide a sound-track for a test plane crash which realized some <a href='http://www.coudal.com/crashvideowin.php?vid=mitch'>good efforts</a>.</p>
