    now (as does Chrome, on the client-side)."

  content: "Eventually.. KML responses would be nice too, but hey, maybe.\r\n\r\nIs
    there anything that supports the geo search extension yet?  (Or time, as that'd
    be interesting too.)"

<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OpenSearch-for-Flickr.jpg"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OpenSearch-for-Flickr-tm.jpg" width="200" height="236" alt="OpenSearch for Flickr" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a>Some of the sites I use most don't support the very nice feature of OpenSearch discovery links. Among these are Flickr and Google Maps - so I first have to navigate to Flickr, then search rather than doing it straight from the browser quick search area.</p>
<p>Fortunately, someone has provided this for me. Just go to <a href="http://mvinetwork.co.uk/opensearch/">http://mvinetwork.co.uk/opensearch/</a> and click open your OpenSearch discovery and add whatever engines you want!</p>
<p>Hopefully more services that already can support OpenSearch templating add the necessary and simple descriptions and discovery links.</p>
<p>For extra credit, you could extend the OpenSearch definition for GMaps to support location name: http://maps.google.com/maps?q={searchTerms}&amp;hnear={geo:locationString?} - and even Flickr supports (and was the model for) OpenSearch-Geo box search.</p>
