<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/social-nola.jpg"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/social-nola-tm.jpg" width="271" height="190" alt="Social Nola.jpg" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a>Last week, <a href="http://thinknola.com/" title="Think New Orleans" rel="coworker">Alan Gutierrez</a> gave an excellent presentation at the Burton Catalyst Group titled <a href="http://thinknola.com/post/indigenous-recovery-software/" title="Think New Orleans &raquo; New Orleans Begins to Develop Indigenous Recovery Software">"How social networking saved New Orleans: Powered by community, New Orleans residents exposed city hall and the power of social software"</a> or "Innovating Your Way Out of Total System Failure" . Get the <a href="%3Cbr/%3Ehttp://blogometer.com/repository/socnola.ppt">slide deck</a> (powerpoint, 32MB)) and <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/How_social_networking_saved_New_Orleans">digg the story here.</a></p>
<p>It's a compelling tale of emergent behavior by a community to leverage the tools it has at hand to enact powerful change. Too often large tools are built to be the end-all-be-all solution to perceived problems and pain points. However, the actual tried and true method of cobbling together solutions from a variety of tools, each as appropriate, leads to agile toolsets and better communication.</p>
<p>On a very similar note, my talk for <a href="http://conference.osgeo.org/foss4g/2008" title="FOSS4G 2008">FOSS4G 2008</a> in Cape Town has been accepted. <a href="http://conference.osgeo.org/index.php/foss4g/2008/paper/view/331" title="FOSS4G Abstract: Rebuilding a City through Community Participation, Neogeography and GIS" rel="me">Rebuilding a City through Community Participation, Neogeography and GIS</a> will present the technical details of utilizing open-data, open-source and closed-source GIS tools, loosely coupled systems, workshops and open discussion to build cartographic visualizations. As a developer I enjoy tech-talk, I find the application based presentations much more interesting.</p>
<p>The presentation will use the <a href="http://maps.thinknola.com">New Orleans mapping</a> as the case study, and while I can't convey the "in-the-field" experiences <a href="http://thinknola.com/" title="Think New Orleans" rel="coworker">Alan</a>, <a href="http://www.regional-modernism.com/" title="Regional Modernism :: The New Orleans Archives" rel="coworker">Francine</a>, <a href="http://www.squanderedheritage.com/" title="Squandered Heritage">Karen</a>, and the others living in the city can tell, I hope I can share the experiences to inspire other communities to employ similar tactics to engage their neighbors and government.</p>
<p>The project is still very much a work in progress, but it's exciting for exactly the reasons Alan gave in his talk - people are already doing the effort and passion - just help them pull the pieces together to have a great impact.</p>
