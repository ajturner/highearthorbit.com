  content: "Where 2.0 frustrates the heck out of me.  \r\n\r\nI wish I could afford
    $2000+ and a week off to attend.  (This is not sarcasm - I've been wanting to
    go to the Web 2.0 conference since its first one, but even with the discounts
    available to me there's just no way I can afford it.)"

<p>For me - the most compelling thing about Where2.0 this year is seeing the round-trip evolution of GeoHackers 3 years ago, to viable, growing businesses. It's been widely recognized that the Where2.0 follow-on, WhereCamp, is where innovators and thinkers spend the weekend considering what the future of location technology is - but now it's even becoming mainstream.</p>
<p>Steve Coast went from a crazy idea, to a <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">global community</a>, to a <a href="http://cloudmade.com">funded-global business</a> and is talking about <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7186" title="Ubiquitous GeoContext: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">Ubiquitous GeoContext</a>. Dennis Crowley has <a href="http://www.dodgeball.com/" title="dodgeball.com ::<br/>mobile social software">done it before</a> and <a href="http://playfoursquare.com/" title="foursquare">doing it again</a> and discussing <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7195" title="Ghosts of Location Based Social Networking Past, Present and Future: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">the social-locative ghosts of past and future</a>.

And there are even more that I believe will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Besides the evolution of Where2.0 - there is a cadre of <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7197" title="Mobile Reality: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">immersive</a>, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7219" title="MarineMap: Crowdsourcing Scientifically Defensible Marine Habitat Protection Areas: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">submersive</a>, subversive, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7177" title="Annotated Reality/ Real Space in Virtual Time - Art Installation: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">pervasive</a>, innovative, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7332" title="Location Amplifier: A New Interaction Framework that Bridges the Real and Virtual Worlds : Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">locative</a>, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7892" title="Mobiles Around the World: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">mobile</a>, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7781" title="Maps from Scratch: Online Maps from the Ground Up: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">design</a>-<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7297" title="">principled</a>, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7148" title="Geospatial Technology Program for sub-Saharan Africa: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">compelling</a>.</p>
<p>And there may even be some cool locative games to join in on.</p>
<p>(<em>disclosure</em>: I am a member of the Where2.0 conference selection committee and as such obviously think everyone speaking is awesome and should be heard by as many people as possible.)</p>
