<p>I ran across <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby/'>GeoRuby</a>, a Ruby gem for handling spatial data types in a database, awhile ago. However, I never sunk my teeth into how it worked and how to get it going.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I settled myself to using the adequate <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/cartographer/'>Cartographer Plugin</a> to easily create Google Maps. I even went so far as to extend Cartographer to switch to Yahoo! maps and MapQuest Maps. </p>
<p>I just came across another mapping gem, <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/ym4r/'>YM4R</a> (yellow maps for Ruby) which handles GoogleMaps v2 (there is a patch for Cartographer to do the same), and Yahoo! maps, local, and traffic. Wow!</p>
<p>Not only that, it's by the same developer of GeoRuby, <a href='http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com'>The Pochi Superstar Mega Show!</a>. </p>
<p>Check out the very good, and complete <a href='http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/2006/06/02/ym4r-georuby-spatial-adapter-demo/'>Ym4r + GeoRuby + Spatial Adapter tutorial</a></p>
