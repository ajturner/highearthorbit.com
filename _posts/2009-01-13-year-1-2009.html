  content: Wow, what an exciting year! I'm currently re-writing my thesis (in which
    your work features prominently ;) ) and second your observation that sometimes
    brain --> paper is a little difficult.  Have a great 2009!

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/2889222583/" title="Buffalo rule the road.jpg by Andrew Turner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/2889222583_ff585af514_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Buffalo rule the road.jpg" style="float:right" /></a>It was another one of those years. Last year I thought was <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/2007-year-in-review/" title="2007 Year in Review :: High Earth Orbit">incredibly busy</a>, and that things would <em>slow down</em>. This has been far from the truth.</p>
<p>In terms of speed, I <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/ajturner/public" title="DOPPLR: Andrew Turner">flew over 50,000 miles</a>, and that doesn't include the driving, trains, and other modes of transit - <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/thoughts-on-china/" title="Thoughts on China :: High Earth Orbit">China</a>, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/upcoming-travel-and-conferences-north-america-africa-europe/" title="Upcoming travel and conferences: North America, Africa, Europe :: High Earth Orbit">Kenya, South Africa, UK</a>, and Italy. And <em>home</em> was an interesting concept, as I <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/heading-out-of-ann-arbor/" title="Heading out of Ann Arbor :: High Earth Orbit">moved houses</a> 5 times in 2008.</p>
<p>Beyond simple logistics, I was a part of some great events: <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/collective-intelligence-a-camp/" title="Collective Intelligence, a Camp :: High Earth Orbit">CIFoo</a> and <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/foocamp-humans-and-machines-get-intimate/" title="FooCamp - humans and machines get intimate :: High Earth Orbit">FooCamp</a> both revolved around similar concepts of the future of humans in technology, I shared my thoughts on neogeography, neocartography and traditional GIS at <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/where20-will-you-be-where/" title="Where2.0 - will you be where? :: High Earth Orbit">Where2.0</a>, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/stanford-lecture-on-location-data-and-mobile-devices/" title="Stanford Lecture on Location Data and Mobile Devices :: High Earth Orbit">Stanford</a>, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/presentation-rebuilding-a-city-through-community-neogeography-and-gis/" title="Presentation: 'Rebuilding a City through Community, Neogeography, and GIS' :: High Earth Orbit">FOSS4G</a>, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/fowa-london-beyond-googlemaps/" title="FOWA London - Beyond GoogleMaps :: High Earth Orbit">Future of Web Apps</a>, and applied these concepts in helping with <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/election-night-at-npr/" title="Election night at NPR :: High Earth Orbit">Twitter Vote Report</a>. I <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/where20-radar-report/" title="Where2.0 Radar Report :: High Earth Orbit">captured</a> these trends in an O'Reilly Radar Report that reminded me how hard it is to convey what is in your brain to linear sheets of paper with graphics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/2919343853/" title="African Trampoline crew by Andrew Turner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2919343853_60511a25f4_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="African Trampoline crew" style="float:left;" /></a>I was also very fortunate to help with mapping of community and growth in <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/netsquared-conference-2008/" title="NetSquared Conference 2008 :: High Earth Orbit">New Orleans</a>. The experiences learned from working with people - from Louisiana to <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/mapping-in-nairobi/" title="Mapping in Nairobi :: High Earth Orbit">Nairobi</a>, food in Mozambique to food in urban gardens - are each amazing and informative in catalyzing the evolving set of capabilities and techniques.</p>
<p>Obviously a big event of 2008 was the company and technology that Mikel and I built, Mapufacture, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/mapufacture-joins-with-fortiusone/" title="Mapufacture joins with FortiusOne :: High Earth Orbit">joining with FortiusOne</a>, which is shaping what 2009 will look like.</p>
<p>And most importantly, I had a great time - and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ajturner/2496421892/" title="Geowankers cooking under the direction of Chef Marc on Flickr - Photo Sharing!"> met </a> many <a href="http://twitter.com/ajturner/friends" title="Twitter">new friends</a>. Thank you for a great 2008.</p>
