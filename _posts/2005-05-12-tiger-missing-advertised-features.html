<p>So, while trying to figure out how to use SQLite, I've been digging around everywhere trying to find out how to applescript access an sqlite database. Sure, there's always <code>do shell script "sqlite3..."</code> but that's *SO* kludgey. Especially when, according to Apple's list of 200+ features, they list:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Data Events Suite<br /><br />
Create and parse SQLite databases.<br />
</blockquote><br />
 on their <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/'>Applescript Tiger Features</a> page. Umm... I've looked in the Developer network, dictionaries, google, Spotlight. <em>Nada</em>, nuthin', zero, zip, zilch.</p>
<p>False Advertising? I doubt it. Lack of documentation? More than likely. Anyone care to point out where this (and other) missing features are?</p>
