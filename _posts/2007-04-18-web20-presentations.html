    place to be. Seemed like they were talking to each other and didn&#8217;t know
    (though Web 2.0 was a kind of massive heard rumble, like migrating water buffalo,

<p>I've been bouncing back and forth between the Location Intelligence Conference and Web2.0. The dichotomy is fascinating. One is filled with geospatial experts wanting to know how to tap into community, the web, and users, but finding them fickle and unapproachable/understandable the other is filled with developers wanting to know how to add location to their applications but finding the geo-landscape varied or difficult. </p>
<p>During one of the Location Intelligence keynotes, a speaker made a comment about how nice it would be to talk into their phone to get directions - and an hour later at Web2.0 Expo a developer talked about how they've added voice control to mobile phones and are looking for good applications.</p>
<p>Feels like the two conferences should be held in the same building and force everyone to sit down and have lunch together. But then, I guess that's why they want developers/users from both sides to meet in the middle and help guide the other field and act as a translator. </p>
<p>For those interested, here is the Web2.0 Expo presentation, <a href="http://mapsomething.com/presentations/web2.0expo/" title="Web2.0 Presentation: Adding Location">Adding Location to Web 2.0 Apps</a>. It was done in the new S5 reloaded (ooh, ajaxy) and really is a quick survey through mapping resources and how we approached and implemented some of these in <a href="http://georss.org/geopress" title="GeoPress" rel="me">GeoPress</a> (due for a 2.4 release as soon as I get back from the conferences, so watch for updates. )</p>
