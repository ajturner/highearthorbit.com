<p>Greetings from Prague. The trip is going great - and don't mind the 30Kr Pivo ($1.20USD 0.5L beers).  I have limited internet access, so difficult to upload some of the great shots I've gotten.</p>
<p>While traveling, I can imagine an incredibly useful technology, where you could rent small handheld GPS receivers & maps that were pre-loaded with sites & tours of a city. As you wonder the city, interesting historical facts pop-up, and routes to sites, hotels, restaurants, etc. show up as well. The device would be small and inexpensive. Perhaps rentable from a central location and as you traveled to different cities, you jacked it into a booth and it uploaded new information. Then when you return the unit, your actual travel logs are downloaded and emailed to you or burned on a CD. Then you would have a time history track of your travels and sites. You could even make your own bookmarks & notes of locations.</p>
<p>I think this is what <a href='http://www.schmap.com/'>Schmap</a> (Dynamic travel guides) is, though I haven't gotten to try out my demo cd that recently came in the mail. However, this still requires a full computer to use. </p>
<p>Off to see a bone church & then to Budapest.</p>
