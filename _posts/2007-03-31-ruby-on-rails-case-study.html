<p>Allan from the <a href="http://www.nonprofittechblog.org/" rel="coworker">NonProfitTechBlog</a> pointed me to this article on infoQ, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/changing-the-present-case-stud" title="Ruby on Rails case study: ChangingThePresent.org">Ruby on Rails case study: ChangingThePresent.org</a>.</p>
<p>The article does a full walk-through, from concept, through development, and to scalability, deliverability, and maintainability, of a Ruby on Rails site/service. </p>
<p>Discussions (arguments) between the various languages and their frameworks are common. It's helpful to see such a readable and poignant presentation of the entire process to address the various issues other developers bring up about the platform. </p>
<p>I have definitely seen the same effects he talks about in the article. Development and updates occur much faster. I can be more productive creating my ideas and getting them to a working prototype. The code is easy to read and small, so its also easy to maintain the code to optimize or extend with new features. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that the other languages or frameworks fail at this, I know that for me, it feels like its the fastest development I can do short of natural language requirements into code ("Make me a Map" <ding!>)</p>
