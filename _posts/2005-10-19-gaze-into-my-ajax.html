<p>I wanted to make the Gaze lookup service an Asynchronous call (AJAX<br />
without the X), but the problem lies in not typically being allowed to<br />
make async calls to a non-local host. Therefore, I wrapped up the Gaze<br />
service in a little PHP code (gaze-rest.php) that has the same API as<br />
the actual gaze service, but acts like a 'local service'.</p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/projects/geocode/geocode.html'>http://highearthorbit.com/projects/geocode/geocode.html</a></p>
<p>The page then makes a Javascript call, which gets the values from the<br />
form and makes the async call. The returned value is put in the<br />
textarea.</p>
<p>Right now I hardcoded the US and GB, but plan on extending it to<br />
actually dynamically fill the options via a find_places_get_countries<br />
call to Gaze.</p>
<p>The source is available as a link at the bottom of the page.</p>
