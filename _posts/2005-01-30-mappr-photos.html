  content: "Yes, in Flickr you specify the town, state, and I guess country, where
    the photo was taken. For example, a picture taken in Detroit, Michigan. would
    have the tags: Detroit Michigan USA. \r\n\r\nJust need to watch that tags with
    spaces (like \"Ann Arbor\") need to have quotes around them. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4040372/'>Example</a>.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I'm look at a Perl script that can pull GPS data from the Exif of a photo
    and another Flash app that can then use this info to display it on a map of my
    own. So much better to roll your own solution. :)"

  content: Actually, the tags "Ann" and "Arbor" will be correctly placed in Ann Arbor,
    if they are in that order. I was finding enough cases like "Las" + "Vegas" that
    I combine the tags in order, to look for place names with spaces in them. Play
    around with http://mappr.com/feed/ to get an idea of the way we
    parse tags.

  content: Thanks for the info Michael. When do you plan on supporting exif geodata?
    There is a really good perl-based exif reader that seems like it would tie in
    nicely with the Flickr API.
