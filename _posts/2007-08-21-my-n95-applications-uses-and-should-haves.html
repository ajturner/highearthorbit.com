  content: I think you should definitely try to install some GNU tools a la Cygwin
    onto the device.  You'll find that scp will work well enough to transfer files
    of various dimensions to and fro various strata.

  content: "@Mapperz - thanks for the info, this is the path that MaemoMapper uses.
    Though we should all push for more open-data so this issue doesn't stay forever.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n@thilo - yeah, I saw the twibble API and would like to incorporate
    into Mapufacture. However, it would be nice if the twibble mobile app included
    this so I can see when people are twittering (or twibbling) near me.\r\n\r\n@emptyset
    - that's just my point (and I'm on a mac, so I don't need Cygwin), but it's not
    easy"

  content: 'When using Nokia Media Manager in iTunes I could not drag tracks to the
    phone either, and it drove me up the wall. The reason is that there is no folders
    on the phone. In iTunes click on the phone in the right hand side and click add
    folder, you can then drag tracks into this folder. i think you cal also drag a
    playlist to the phone as well. This also works similarly in iPhoto too. '

    quite nicely. I also browse my laptop and copy the files over via Wifi, through
    the router or even an ad-hoc Wifi network. Hope this helps :)

  content: "In iTunes, you cannot drag songs directly into the N95 folder; instead
    create a playlist inside it (click on the folder, then the \"+\" button).  NOW
    drag songs into the new playlist, and they will be transferred to your N95 next
    time you sync.\r\n\r\nOnce new songs are on the N95, you need to \"refresh libary\"
    (or somesuch) within the media player, to update its playlist."

    transferring music to your n95 via itunes.  I sync every night, so whenever i
    add new tunes, they are ready for me tomorrow.

    the search icon in in the Menu, then searched music and songs and they were all
    there. \r\nDoes anyone know how to add these songs onto the playlist or will she
    have to redownload them onto the phone?"

But, because I'm a geek, I currently use the N95 (and it has 'uses').</p>
<p>Overall, the device is very <em>nice</em>. It is Nokia's best phone yet - great feel, (except there is a little play in the slider face), small, great feature set: WiFi, GPS, MicroSD, 5-megapixel camera with good optics and a flash.</p>
<p>The first thing that attracted me to the N95 was the good camera. I really wanted to be able to take <em>decent</em> shots while out and about in my life without having to carry a camera. The N95 is the perfect fit. I can take a shot, know it will look good enough for a candid photo, and have it uploaded to my online photo store immediately. Having it geotagged is a huge added flavor favor. </p>
<p>So getting to the GPS, besides the camera, this was the only other feature that was really a 'must have' for me - because of my fascination with location. Here is a list of the GPS-enabled applications that I use on a regular basis. There are some others, but I installed them just to play with them, and these are ones I use nearly daily. </p>

<dd>great app for recording GPS tracks, can save as GPX or KML and even email. Unfortunately, no <abbr title="Atom Publishing Protocol">APP</abbr> support (yet)</dd></p>

<dd>incredibly full featured mapping application, tracker, and local search. Recently got a cease-and-decist for using Google Maps Tiles (gee, <a href="http://www.google.com/gmm/index.html" title="Google Maps Mobile">wonder why</a>), but fortunately I pointed out <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> to the developer several months ago and within days he added it as an option (free maps on your phone!)

<h3>Missing Apps</h3><br />
While these apps are fun, there are definitely some missing apps or software:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://plazes.com/" title="Plazes">Plazes</a> (or <a href="http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/" title="FireEagle Development">FireEagle</a>, or some other generic HereIAmWhereAreMyFriends) mobile application - didn't they <em>use to</em> have one?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html" title="Atom Publishing Format and Protocol (atompub) Charter">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> support for grabbing nearby locations and uploading new locations and tracks</li>
<li>Integration of GPS with <a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog" title="Nokia - Nokia Lifeblog">LifeBlog</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>And here's another major hiccup - The N95 has unlimited storage via memory cards - I am a technogeek, yet I <em>still</em> can't get music or media onto my device. Yeah, there is a Nokia Media Manager for Mac - and my phone shows up in iTunes - but I can't actually add anything to the device. I try to drag-n-drop and it just snaps back. Not there, no message, no music - unhappy user.</p>
<p>This is something so simple, and so fundamental to Nokia's primary feature set I'm amazed that it's so horribly implemented. So while I don't need to carry another camera with me, and rarely carry my N800 anymore, I <strong>still</strong> carry my iPod for quick trips. </p>
<h3>I mean what I said</h3><br />
As great as the N95 is, for as long as Symbian has been around there should be a lot more great applications out there. Instead, developing a J2ME or C++ application for the N95 (which may not work on the N80, or N6600, or N800, which means redeveloping for every platform) is extremely difficult and time-consuming. And that's not even addressing the overhead required by a user to find and then choose to install your application - easily a 5-step process, that may even fail and leave unknown bits around you mobile that you later have to reflash to clean up.</p>
<p>Instead, Nokia should really team up with Opera to re-release and finalize the <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/widgets/" title="Opera for Windows Mobile Pocket PC">Opera Platform</a>, a kind of iPhone WebKit competitor that allows developers to quickly build rich web-applications with hooks into the phone unit itself. I don't want to have to worry about file systems, buttons, synchronization, et al. I just want to develop my app, send someone a link - or even better - build something like <a href="http://appmarks.com/" title="AppMarks">AppMarks</a>, <a href="http://www.getleaflets.com/" title="Leaflets: iPhone apps that grow on you.">Leaflets</a>, <a href="http://mockdock.com/" title="MockDock - User Signup">MockDock</a>, or <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/07/16/iphone-gridgets-widgets-for-your-iphone/" title="iPhone Gridgets: Widgets for your iPhone - The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)">Gridgets</a> (to name <em>just a few</em> that showed up <em>within weeks</em> of the iPhone release).</p>
