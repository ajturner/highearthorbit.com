  content: "Heh! My point was is that they *are* compatible, which is why I said ...\r\n\r\n\"The
    only step missing is for either Flickr to output KML natively ... \"\r\n\r\nThe
    bbox being used as a parameter on the Flickr API was designed from the start to
    be the same as the bbox from Google Earth. Just so it'd be possible at some point
    to point Google Earth directly at the Flickr backend (with extra optional parameters
    passed if you wanted).\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, as we most certainly have more
    processing power to handle the request load than someone else having to use their
    API key and code to convert our XML format to KML.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it hasn't
    happened yet is just because we've been working on other things ... and need to
    check that we indeed can handle the load :) \r\n\r\nI haven't even looked into
    the politics of (Flickr! "

<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/12/googles_geograp.html" title="O'Reilly Radar: Google's Geographic Layer Permalink">Brady points out on O'Reilly Radar</a> some of the new layers in GoogleEarth. Most interesting though is his recap of feedback from Flickr's Dan Catt on why Google isn't currently displaying Flickr photos (despite perhaps the obvious that (Flickr! < Yahoo!) != Google).  </p>
<p>His claim is that they take their bounding box parameters in different order: bbox=x1,y1,x2,y2. vs. box=x1,y1,x2,y2. However, based on my research of the API's, they look comparable. For example, Google Earth's <a href="http://earth.google.com/kml/kml_tut.html#refresh_queries" title="KML Tutorial: refresh queries">view based refresh</a> will do a bounding box request: </p>
<p>  <code>longitude_west, latitude_south, longitude_east, latitude_north</code></p>
<p>and the Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html" title="Flickr API: search">photo search expects</a> the following BBox:</p>
<p> <code>minimum_longitude, minimum_latitude, maximum_longitude, maximum_latitude</code></p>
<p>You can see that <code>minimum_longitude</code> is the same parameter as <code>longitude_west</code>, and so on. So I'm not sure why Dan Catt uses that as his explanation that the parameters don't line up. </p>
<p>However, as Brady points out, what would really help everyone is if the services all spoke common languages, like Flickr outputting KML, or GoogleEarth consuming GeoRSS (since Flickr can output GeoRSS). My money would be on the latter, since there seems less impetus for a company like Flickr/Yahoo to export their data in a proprietary format. </p>
<p>Of course, the translation between the two formats, especially for basic geometry such as points, is trivial, so implementing both on both sides, or simple conversion utilities in the middle, would be straight-forward. </p>
<h3>Extra Credit</h3><br />
For extra credit, implement said conversion utility to convert KML <=> GeoRSS using XSLT, or other language of your choice.</p>
<p>There are also various other Flickr/GoogleEarth utilities out there like <a href="http://www.beaugunderson.com/flickr/">displaying grids of  the # of Flickr images</a> in GoogleEarth. </p>
<h3>Pleasant Surprise</h3><br />
While researching parts of this post, I found a new Flickr API method that I didn't know existed before:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getWithGeoData.html">flickr.photos.getWithGeoData</a>  - "Returns a list of your geo-tagged photos." However, you can't do a search within this set other than by date. But at least now you can pull up a trail of your travels based on your photos. </p>
<p>"Where were you on the night of the 13th?!"</p>
<p>In the past, when using my Feed URL to get geotagged photos, I just made sure that photos had a tag "geotagged" and then grabbed all the photos with that tag. </p>
