<p><img src="http://guerrillageographyday.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cropped-ggd-logo-web-35.jpg?w=196&amp;h=55" alt="Guerilla Geography" style="float:right; padding: 5px 0 5px 5px;" />As part of Geography Awareness Week National Geographic hosted a talk about <a href="http://guerrillageography.blogspot.com/">guerrilla geography</a> by <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/daniel-raven-ellison/">Daniel Raven-Ellison</a>. You can read more about Daniel's work on <a href="http://ravenellison.com/">his site</a> or blog <a href="http://thegeographycollective.wordpress.com/" title="The Geography Collective">The Geography Collective</a>.</p>
<p>Daniel's talk was enjoyable and resonated with what made me adopt geography as a new career. He passionately seeks to experience and perceive places and to teach others. His <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1904872441" title="Mission: Explore Food: The Geography Collective, Tom Morgan-Jones: 9781904872443: Amazon.com: Books">Mission:Explore</a> books provide intriguing experiments, particularly for children, to learn more about where they live, how they move, the history, culture, and environment of places. And particularly relevant to <em>guerilla</em> geography, about how they can impact and influence this space as a medium for expression and commumity.</p>
<p>He also riffed a bit on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography" title="Psychogeography - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">psychogeography</a> and reminded me of <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/category/psychogeography/" title="psychogeography &Acirc;&laquo; thinkwhere">Tim Waters'</a> <em>sense tours</em> where he advises people to stop when they see something interesting, close their eyes and smell or hear in order to leverage the other senses in really understanding a place. Or <a href="http://www.softhook.com/" title="Christian Nold">Christian Nold's</a> biomapping and <a href="http://www.sensoryjourneys.net/" title="Sensory Journeys">sensory journeys</a>. Daniel has done "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8j7B-kmas&amp;feature=plcp">urban earth" walks through major cities</a> while taking a photo every 8 steps. The result is a visceral flow through living urban centers giving you a mere glimpse of the life, paths, and people that inhabit these areas.</p>

It has large similarities and goals to my work in <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/category/geo/" title="Neogeography :: High Earth Orbit">Neogeography</a> which utilizes potentially more advanced, and often technical, tools but in similarly colloquial ways to share stories and personal experiences with location. What's also interesting about his work is that he introduces the scientific method in subtle ways such as challenging kids to record the outcome of days they walk under a ladder and days they don't in order to determine if there is in fact an impact on one's luck.</p>
<p>Perhaps more controversial, but arguably important, he encourages children to "Meet your meat" that you're going to eat. Visit the local farm to see the cows, sheep, or other animals and understand the flow of food through the land and from the environment that forms your meals.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if they'll post his talk from this week, but you can <a href="http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/specials/nat-geo-live-specials/raven-ellison-geography-lecture-nglive/" title="Video -- NG Live!: Daniel Raven-Ellison: Guerrilla Geography -- National Geographic">watch his talk from NatGeo Live!</a>.</p>
