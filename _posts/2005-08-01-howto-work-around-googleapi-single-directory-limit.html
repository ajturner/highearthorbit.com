  content: Well, you could just have the iframe source pass the width and height as
    a part of the parameters and output them in the iframe document. That would be
    a simple and elegant solution.

  content: "I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean. I could do:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<iframe
    src='page.php?height=200&width=200' height='200px' width='200px'/>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhich
    is what I've actually done on my pages, but this still does repeat the height
    &amp; width. Is there a <em>slicker</em> way?"

<p>The GoogleAPI, when publicly released as version 1, required the use of an API key that is assigned to a user on a <em>per directory</em> basis. What this means is that the particular GoogleMap API key can only be used in that particularly directory on a website and not any other directory. For example, a key generated for <code>highearthorbit.com/maps/</code> would not work for </p>
<ul>
<li><code>highearthorbit.com/</code></li>
<li><code>highearthorbit.com/projects/location</code></li>
<li><code>www.highearthorbit.com/</code></li>
<li><code>www.highearthorbit.com/maps/</code></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>This is particularly a problem when your website uses rewrites to make <em>per-tee</em> urls for posts instead of the ?p=141. Each post looks like a separate directory and therefore the sidebar with map you see to your right (if you're not viewing the RSS feed) doesn't work.</p>
<p>The work around for this is to place the GoogleMap in an iframe, which is an <em>inline frame</em> and acts as a window to another webpage. That webpage is just a GoogleMap that sits at the base directory of your website. Any other page can now include that GoogleMap by using a single API-key.</p>
<p>To illustrate, your webpage would include the following html where appropriate:</p>
<p><code><iframe src="http://highearthorbit.com/googleMapFrame.php?lat=42<br />
&amp;lon=-120" height="200px" width="200px" frameborder="No" scrolling="No"></iframe></code></p>
<p>The corresponding googleMapFrame.php is just a wrapper around the GoogleMap call and code. This file needs to reside in the directory where you generated your API-key:</p>
<p><code><br />
<html><br/><br />
<head><br/><br />
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;v=1&amp;<br />
key=YourKeyHere" type="text/javascript"></script>^M<br/><br />
<body><br/></p>
<div id="googlemap" style="width:200px;height:200px;"><br/><br />
<script type="text/javascript"><br/><br />
<br/><br />
// Create a map with small controls<br/><br />
myMap = new GMap ( document.getElementById ( "googlemap" )  ) ;<br/><br />
myMap.centerAndZoom ( new GPoint ( <?=$_GET['lon']?>,  <?=$_GET['lat']?> ) ,  4 ) ;<br/><br />
myMap.addControl ( new GSmallMapControl (  )  ) ;<br/><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br />
// Add the location marker passed in via the url<br/><br />
var point = new GPoint ( <?=$_GET['lon']?>,  <?=$_GET['lat']?> ) ;<br/><br />
var marker = new GMarker ( point ) ;<br/><br />
myMap.addOverlay ( marker ) ;<br/><br />
</script><br/><br />
</head><br/><br />
</body><br/><br />
</html><br />
</code></p>
<p>That's all you have to do. This work around actually has the nice effect of making adding a GoogleMap to the website very easy. I don't have to worry about including the initial GMap javascript include, or creating a div container and then calling the javascript code. I just put the iframe whereever I want it on the page and *poof!*, there it is.</p>
<p>It would also be a good idea to add the ability to set the size of the GoogleMap (and iframe) on a per page basis, and do multiple waypoints, tracks etc. Essentially a fully functional mini-api wrapper around the larger GoogleMap API. </p>
