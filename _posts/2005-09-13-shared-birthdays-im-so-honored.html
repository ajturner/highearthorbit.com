  content: "Happy birthday! \r\n\r\nApparently the Sooners of Oklahoma decided to
    celebrate your birthday by stealing your idea. Damn Big 12 and their corrupt ethics!\r\n\r\n\"A
    group at the University of Oklahoma has created a Mac Mini-based robot:\r\n\r\nThis
    is a description of a mobile robot using an Mac Mini and iSight camera for tele-operation.
    The purpose of this project is to see what it is like to control to robot using
    the built-in visual and aural sensors before designing an agent to do the same
    task. The robot is a Pioneer 3-AT made by ActivMedia and the Mac Mini was graciously
    provided by Apple computer at no charge. Dr. Amy McGovern provided the iSight
    camera. \r\n  The tests were preformed at the Stephenson Research and Technology
    Center located at University of Oklahoma. Our group, part of the Artificial Intelligence
    Research laboratory in Computer Science, was interested in evaluating the Mac
    Mini because of its small size, built-in wireless and firewire capabilities.\"\r\n\r\nAs
    seen at Macintouch and Arstechnica, among others."

  content: "Yeah, well, I can't post my article up for another month, but I encourage
    everyone to go out and pick up a September issue of MacTech magazine (mactech.com)
    for my article on building and programming your own Mac-Mini robot.\r\n\r\nI'll
    post some pictures at least this weekend. "

Perhaps you've heard of him? He's prone to wearing red overalls and has a wicked mustachio. </p>
<p>Check out the <a href='http://www.nintendo.co.jp/mario20th/index.html'>Japanese celebration page</a> </p>
<p>Of course, this may explain why the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo'>Super Nintendo</a> came out a couple of days early and I got one on my birthday so long ago in 1991. Super Mario Brothers was the <str>best</str>.</p>
<p>And 28 years ago <em>to the day</em>, GM introduced the first Diesel consumer automobiles, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_88'>Oldsmobile 88</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile_98'>98</a> models. </p>
