  content: "A really useful script. I amended it to write \"image_comment\" to the
    EXIF fields \"Description\" and \"Image Description\" instead - this way it is
    compatible with the way Photoshop writes EXIF data. I also added the fields \"Artist\"
    and \"URL\" to include my name and website btw. \r\n\r\n(Note that \"URL\" appears
    to be a reserved word; hence I had to rename the variable at the start to \"site\"
    to get it to run properly.) "

  content: "Hi\r\n\r\nThanks for the script ideas.  I've got exiftool installed and
    got a coup0le of my own scripts to write the EXIF data.\r\n\r\nI've got a script
    that will update the iPhoto photo comment.  It took me a while to figure out that
    the iPhoto comment wasn't part of the EXIF or IPTC metadata (silly way to do it
    if you ask me).\r\nAnyways, that script works fine.  The comment gets updated
    immediately in iPhoto.\r\n\r\nAnother script I have using exiftool updates the
    EXIF maker, model, usercomment, and artist tags.  However, none of these changes
    show up in iPhoto!\r\nFinding the file in the Finder and checking the EXIF content
    reveals all the stuff my script added.  So the script works.  But how do I get
    it so the new EXIF data shows up in iPhoto?\r\n\r\nIf I export the photo, the
    EXIF data is there.  If I then import that exported photo, iPhoto even refers
    to it as a duplicate!  This \"duplicate\" does show up with the correct EXIF info
    in iPhoto now.\r\nSo exporting ALL the changed photos and then re-importing them
    would work but that's obviously a last resort.\r\n\r\nDo you know of a way to
    \"reset\" a photo so iPhoto will refresh the EXIF metadata and display it?\r\n\r\nI've
    tried the options of rebuilding the iPhoto library with option-command at app
    startup but no luck.\r\n\r\nI've seen your other post about \"iPhoto was often
    beligerent and required a restart of the iPhoto (and possible database recreation)
    to read the location information (which was viewable in the 'info&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    panel).\"\r\nSo what did you actually do to get it to work?\r\n\r\nI'm hoping
    a newly improved iPhoto gets released next week at MacWorld Expo!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for any suggestions and comments you can provide!"

  content: That's a brilliant script - thanks. It's particularly great with Keyword
    Assistant for iPhoto, as you can just go through and easily tag everything, then
    use this to synchronise. I've also got it setup with Quicksilver so it's nice
    and quick to run the script.  Only problem so far is that if you run the script
    on the same photo a few times, it appends the keywords, so you get multiple keywords
    that are the same on the photo. That's probably something to do with the exiftool
    command line... just off to have a look at the man page now!

    of the script to simply add the iPhoto date as the Original Date in the EXIF header
    within my iPhoto library... which also applies to any exported versions, etc.
    (NOTE: it works, but I have no clue about applescript, so this may not be 100%
    correct, it's just based on my trial-and-error).\r\n\r\nBasically in the \"tell
    this_photo\" part I added:\r\nset the image_date to the date\r\n\r\nand then changed
    the exiftool shell script call to simply be:\r\n\"exiftool -DateTimeOriginal='\"
    &amp; image_date &amp; \"' \" &amp; \"'\" &amp; image_file &amp; \"'\"\r\n\r\nDunno
    if that's useful to anyone, but this result saves me hours and hours of trouble
    in terms of getting my (properly dated) photos from iPhoto to Gallery 2.2 (http://gallery.menalto.com/)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nRyan"

    viewing this:\r\n\r\nThink anyone could build in a versioning comment system that
    lets a commenter mark up (any) code, hide the revised full version behind css
    (or something) while showing the markups? (It would have to roll into a blog/new
    commenting system)\r\n\r\nWould be great for a page like this, where there would
    have been at least 3 different versions so far, and encourage more."

    by modifying the script by adding single quotes around each keyword, as it is
    already done for the other tags (have a look at the code above).\r\n\r\nI.e. change
    this part to:\r\n\r\nrepeat with j from 1 to the count of assigned_keywords\r\n\tset
    the keywordslist to keywordslist &amp; \" -keywords+='\" &Acirc;&not;\r\n\t\t&amp;
    item j of assigned_keywords  &amp; \"'\"\r\nend repeat\r\n\r\nNote that it might
    be also more practical to change the += to =, as somebody already commented.\r\n\r\nWhat
    could be also added is storing the rating information, I think it should be available
    via Applescript as well."

  content: "About the apostrophe problem:\r\n\r\nYour guess is probably correct. Seems
    a more generic solution would be needed.\r\n\r\nOne idea would be to write the
    tag/content as tab-separated pairs to a temporary file and then let exiftool
    read that file.\r\n\r\nThat file could probably be also stdin, leading to something
    like this (note that this is a coarse example from memory without any syntax check):\r\n\r\ndo
    shell script \"echo Keywords \\t\" item j of assigned_keywords | exiftool -t ...\r\n\r\n(Note
    the piping character. I hope you are a bit familiar with unix scripting.)\r\n\r\n\r\n(BTW,
    regarding my previous comment about the rating info: for reading, that seems to
    be available only via the plist iPhoto archive file, for writing, UI scripting
    would be needed. Of course it is also not very difficult to generate rating-based
    tags like R0, R1, R2..R5.)"

  content: "More on the apostrophe issue, this is a quick hack:\r\n\r\nOf course,
    you can also quote the string with the parenthesis character, then it would probably
    look like this:\r\n\r\n'exiftool -title=\"' &amp; image_title &amp; &Acirc;&not;\r\n'\"
    ' &amp; keywordslist...\r\n\r\nThat way, you can use the apostrophe within the
    title (but not the parenthesis).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe better solution (that will allow
    all characters) will probably need to be based on exiftool's argfile option:\r\n\r\nFrom
    the exiftool documentation:\r\n\r\n\"-@ ARGFILE\r\n\r\nRead command-line arguments
    from the specified file. The file contains one argument per line (NOT one option
    per line -- some options require additional arguments which must be placed on
    separate lines). Blank lines and lines beginning with # and are ignored. Normal
    shell processing of arguments is not performed, which among other things means
    that arguments should not be quoted. ARGFILE may exist relative to either the
    current directory or the exiftool directory unless an absolute pathname is given.
    \r\nFor example, the following ARGFILE will set the value of Copyright to ``Copyright
    YYYY, Phil Harvey'', where ``YYYY'' is the year of CreateDate:\r\n\r\n    -d\r\n
    \   %Y\r\n    -copyright<Copyright $createdate, Phil Harvey\""

  content: "First of all, thank you for this script: it's nice, it issues a problem
    I care about, and it seems is the best thing available.\r\nMy main goal is to
    avoid loosing all the comments written in iPhoto if the files are exported.\r\n\r\nI
    have the '09 version of iPhoto.\r\n\r\n@iStar yes, it works on the \"modified\"
    file, not on the original. Though, when you export the photo, if you choose the
    right \"kind\" when exporting, and ask to include \"title and keywords\" and  \"location
    information\", the exif fields will be written in the exported file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    problem seems to be that the scripts works fine, and is actually able to write
    the required fields in the exif info of the \"modified\" file, but all the exif
    info present in the original file are lost!\r\n\r\nNow, I am trying to figure
    out how to \"merge\" all the exif fields, so to be able to export a file that
    has all the exif informations (i.e. all the fields), those from the original file
    (written by the camera) and those from iPhoto (e.g. the comments)"

    When you're replacing the single - with two real dashes make sure that you check
    that the subtraction signs for the date and time calculation are functional.\r\n\r\nHappy
    iPhotoing :-)"
