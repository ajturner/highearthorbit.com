<p>I'm trying to determine how best to go about giving my house a soul (good or bad to be determined, but I know where I'm putting my money). Of course, this is a new project after getting <a href='http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/smarthomehks/'>O'Reilly's Smart Home Hacks</a> book for Christmas from my sister. She's just fueling the gadget fire. ;)</p>
<p>The first question lies in how I want to approach this. There are a couple of primary things I want the system to handle while accomplishing some small tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web-access - Specifically via my laptop, work, or cell-phone (non-wap)</li>
<li>Easily setup & scriptable - I'm tired of fooling around with too low-level hacks and spending all my time just getting them going.</li>
<li>Work from a Mac - I primarily use a Powermac G5 that I can begin testing with and then move it to a dormant Beige G3 sitting in the basement. Of course, there <em>is</em> still that rumor of a possibly headless Mac at MWSF</li>
<li>Prefer USB</li>
<li>Audrey Interface</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The options are: <a href='http://www.perceptiveautomation.com/indigo/'>Indigo</a>, <a href='http://www.shed.com/'>XTension</a>, <a href='http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/'>MisterHouse</a> for software; and using the <a href='http://www.smarthome.com/1132U.html'>PowerLinc USB</a>, <a href='http://www.smarthome.com/1132.html'>PowerLinc Serial</a>, or <a href='http://www.smarthome.com/1140.html'>ActiveHome CM11A Serial</a> computer interface modules.<br />
Nothing appears to meet all my needs yet. I think I prefer Indigo with the PowerLinc USB, but Indigo is (1) Expensive, when compared to free, and (2) doesn't natively provide a web-interface, but requires <em>another</em> ACGI dispatcher for $35. </p>

<p>There are trial versions of all the above packages. So I can give them a try. The first step is to get a controller box. For some reason, I'm leaning towards the PowerLinc USB, since then I don't have to buy & deal with a USB-Serial dongle, but that seems to be of questionable support, for some reason. So I'll probably get the CM11A and stay with compatability for the time being.</p>
