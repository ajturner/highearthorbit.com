<p>Directions<br />
from highlands, Hwy 106 South 6.8 mi to Scaly Mtn. Left onto Hale Ridge Road, b/w Ski slope + post office. Continue on road, follow fork to the right (road name). After 2.2 miles make a left onto Kelsey Mtn Rd, there is a National park Trail head sign on the left. If you see a "Blind Drive" sign you've gone to far. Approx. 1 mile the road dead-ends at the trail head. Park in the cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>Description<br />
Simple start, several steep switchbacks (very difficult in winter) increasing views of sky. 1 or 2 obstructed views of landscape before top. Stone/mason constructed firetower w/ steep wooden staircase leads to large viewing platform w/ benches. Can be windy.</p>
<p>View at top spectacular.</p>
