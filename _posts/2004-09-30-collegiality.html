<p>NetNewsWire has published their <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/rssclipboard.php">NetNewsWire RSS Clipboard Formats</a>. What this allows is dragging and dropping newsfeeds and headlines in between supporting apps.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do is to be able to drag-and-drop newsfeeds from NetNewsWire or PulpFiction, to name two, onto SpyTrack to get newsfeeds.</p>
<p>Also - I'm trying to determine if the Geo-Enabled RSS viewer needs to be split off from SpyTrack. Or somehow as an optional add-in module. Adding the RSS feed support is really complicating the original purpose behind SpyTrack. But then again, having all your info in one app/window seems beneficial. </p>
