<p>Yet Another Solar Powered Airship, this time <a href='http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=24176'>Purdue is doing it.</a></p>
<p>It's amusing how many times this comes up and people think it's a novel concept. It's been around for quite a while and no one has yet to do it.</p>
<p>The article concludes with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Engineers are not yet certain how large the airship might be, but it may be as long as 300 meters, or around 900 feet - roughly four times the length of the Goodyear blimp. A major challenge will be finding materials for the airship's skin that are capable of withstanding the extreme ultraviolet radiation at such high altitudes for extended periods, Sullivan said.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>Same problems, different group. Keep at it boys.</p>
