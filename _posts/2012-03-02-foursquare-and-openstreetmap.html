  content: Thanks Jos&Atilde;&copy; - though I'm not exactly sure what your pictures
    words are saying. I see just about the same amount of data in both maps. The styling
    of OpenStreetMap is not as visually pleasing, but that's not the point here. Perhaps
    you can share just a few of the thousands words to help clarify.

  content: "@Jos&Atilde;&copy;\r\nWhat if you want to present a basemap in your application
    that cannot have yellow roads? (because you need to display some kind of network,
    or whatever, in which the link colors are mainly yellow). \r\n\r\nYou can't compare
    the kind of flexibility one have when using a OSM data. You can control the it
    and use it for your best purpose.\r\n\r\nYou want pretty maps? A 3 minutes look
    up in a search engine (try google, for instance) can show you at least 10 different
    styles that put GMaps in a corner.. None suits you? Build your  own a serve the
    tiles.. it's easy! Again, the OSM data it's at your disposal. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/sanfrancisco-11.jpg\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/sanfrancisco-13.jpg\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/sanfrancisco-15.jpg\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/newyork-16.jpg\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/moscow-14.jpg\r\nhttps://github.com/migurski/OSM-Solar/raw/master/renders/london-12.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://underdark.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/osmplugin_light.png"

Say hi to pretty new maps! | Foursquare Blog">FourSquare announced</a> that they switched their website maps from Google Maps to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> data hosted by MapBox. In what has been a growing trend of broader adoption, FourSquare remarks the utility and success of OpenStreetMap. Additionally it's another movement in the recent <a href="http://switch2osm.org/" title="switch2osm | ">switch2osm campaign</a> since Google <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/google-maps-terms-of-service-and-pay-choice/" title="HighEarthOrbit: Google Maps Terms of Service and Pay">began requiring paid licensing</a> for high-usage of the once completely free Google Maps.</p>
<p>Currently the switch is only for the website, which I admit I have used less than a dozen times and the mobile application will still be using the native Google Maps libraries. There are a number of valid reasons for this, not least of which is that Google is not yet charging for mobile maps usage, though I imagine it only a matter of time before they do and also for developers to build comparable mobile mapping libraries for OpenStreetMap.</p>
<h3>Value of the Basemap</h3></p>
<p>There are several intriguing aspects of this <em>announcement</em> as well as the reaction. First is that the change of the basemap, while intriguing to the geospatial and data communities, is likely highly irrelevant to most FourSquare users. Would there have been much news had the switch been to Microsoft Bing maps? Probably not. The interest is clearly impacted by the community, and general good will, of the OpenStreetMap project. Each adoption by a major company further verifies its value, as well as solidifies its continuity as organizations build their own business with OpenStreetMap as a core component.</p>
<p>Second is that there have been a number of companies whose primary, or recent, goal has been to be a trusted provider of OpenStreetMap basemaps. <a href="http://cloudmade.com/" title="CloudMade - The Leading Platform for Creating and Monetizing Unique Applications With Location">CloudMade</a>, started by one of the founders of OpenStreetMap Steve Coast, was created for exactly this purpose. Additionally <a href="http://open.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> has been using OpenStreetMap as a tactic to increase adoption of their long-standing mapping platform as well as insure themselves against likely increasing commercial data provider costs. However it was an <em>extremely recent</em> technology, albeit from a longer established company, to be the one to provide the OpenStreetMap basemap for FourSquare.</p>
<p><a href="http://developmentseed.org/" title="Development Seed">Development Seed</a>'s <a href="http://mapbox.com/" title="MapBox | MapBox">MapBox</a> is truly a compelling creation of technology and innovation. They have done extremely well adopting the best of breed software, and the development team that built it, with <a href="http://mapnik.org/" title="Welcome">Mapnik</a>. And they combined it with new technology to make it fast, and a differentiating and compelling story for developers by using Node.js. Technical details aside, the design and thought into the representation of OpenStreetMap clearly was a key differentiator in FourSquare using Mapbox to serve their OpenStreetMap tiles. And I'll also add that Development Seed is a local DC and East Coast company - something I don't doubt was interesting to the New York based FourSquare in pushing against the typical Silicon Valley technology scene.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end it is just a basemap. This is the background canvas that contains the actually valuable information that FourSquare has gathered and users engage with. The switch from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap does not in any way change the value or usage of the FourSquare application and community. Technically there is no real difference - it's possible to restyle most any basemap today, and I imagine the switch from one provider to another was a relatively trivial code switch. FourSquare, or others, could just as easily switch to a new basemap if it was important to them as a business or their community.</p>
<h3>More than a Basemap</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/OpenStreetMap-Editing-Belga-Cafe.png"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/OpenStreetMap-Editing-Belga-Cafe-tm.jpg" width="300" height="166" alt="OpenStreetMap Editing Belga Cafe" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a>What I am most excited about, and believe FourSquare has an almost unique potential to enable, is the adoption of OpenStreetMap as more than just the canvas for visualizing check-in's and user activity. OpenStreetMap's true value is that it is an open, editable, relational database of geographic data - where the basemap is merely <em>one way</em> to access the information. What makes OpenStreetMap the future of location data is that the information can only get better, more up to date more quickly, and better representative of unique and varied views of a person's place.</p>
<p>Several years ago Dennis and I had a conversation just after the initial launch of FourSquare about the potential of using OpenStreetMap. At the beginning, FourSquare only worked in specific cities, and in his considering how to expand it everywhere the options were between having a blank database and having an OpenStreetMap populated dataset. Obviously the tremendous potential was having the then nascent community of FourSquare users using and updating OpenStreetMap data. Unfortunately for usability and I assume <em>business</em> reasons (e.g. build your own database that you can own) FourSquare didn't adopt OpenStreetMap at that time.</p>
<p>However, imagine if FourSquare adopted just this technique. Leverage their <a href="http://blog.foursquare.com/2011/06/20/holysmokes10millionpeople/" title="Wow! The foursquare community has over 10,000,000 members! | Foursquare Blog">millions of users</a> to improve the OpenStreetMap database. OpenStreetMap itself suffers from the common platform issue of being everything to everyone. This is confusing for new users that want to contribute to know where to begin. They may just want to include the road in front of their house - or the park down the street and the great coffee shop they frequent. Unfortunately the interface for performing these activities often requires understanding of British terminology of places and an overwhelming choice of categories, tags, and drawing options.</p>
<p>FourSquare by contrast is forced to be simple and focused. Users are quickly engaging and disengaging with the application that should capture the data and reflect it to the user for verification. Because my activity is being tracked, FourSquare can know that I'm on foot in the US and in an urban area, so don't start by showing me hiking trails, or highways but show me restaurant and relevant places of interest - allowing me to dive deeper if I want to but making it simple for the casual user to improve the data. I believe that only through simple and focused user applications will OpenStreetMap broadly enter into the common use and be able to reach the end tail of location data.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumes FourSquare, specifically the investors and board, don't see their user collected place data as a key and protected dataset. There have been enough POI selling companies in a dying market. There are now businesses such as Factual, and still CloudMade, who are focused on making this data openly available - though themselves as brokers to the data.</p>
<p>Despite continuing to cross numerous impressive adoption hurdles and over seven years of development, OpenStreetMap is still a young project. Its adoption by FourSquare is indeed another momentous occasion that heralds optimism that it will continue to grow. And as companies like Development Seed, CloudMade, MapQuest <a href="http://switch2osm.org/providers/" title="Switch2OSM Providers">and others</a> adopt OpenStreetMap as a core to their business - providing not just services but truly engaging with the community and providing focused context and value, OpenStreetMap will only get better.</p>
