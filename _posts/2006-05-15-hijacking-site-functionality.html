<p>A couple of days ago I <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/greaseroute-mapping-the-web/'>mentioned</a> some Greasemonkey scripts I wrote. One of them, which I didn't discuss, is particularly devious.</p>
<p>What happens when users have the ability to hijack sites and how they expect to be used? For example, there are scripts to provide mapping functionality within Flickr!, or to <a href='http://userscripts.com/scripts/show/1311'>compare book prices</a> on Amazon.com with other vendors.</p>
<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/MapThis.png' alt='MapThis' align='right' hspace='5px' vspace='5px'/><a href='http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4019'>MapThis!</a> overrides the "Map This!" link that shows up in GMail when an address is detected. Instead of linking to just a plain-ol' googlemap, the link is "hijacked" to provide routing directions from the user's geolocated position (using <a href='http://hostip.info'>HostIP</a>) to the address in the email.</p>
<p>This is useful, for example, if a friend sends you the address of their house, or that cool roller-rink with disco ball that you're meeting up at and you want to quickly get directions.</p>
<p>It also demonstrates how a user isn't limited by the interface a site-designer supplied, allowing them to customize and use the site as they wan. </p>
