  content: 'For those who want to know more about chicory and how it tastes, I would
    review <a href="http://coffeetea.about.com/od/coffeesubstitutes/gr/chicory.htm"
    rel="nofollow">Roasted Chicory: The Bottom Line</a>. I was curious how New
    Orleans coffee could taste good (or at least it wasn''t memorably bad with my
    beignets). Then I remembered that at the <a href="http://www.cafedumonde.com/history.html"
    rel="nofollow">Cafe du Monde</a>, the coffee can be prepared black or au lait.
    Obviously the cafe au lait with several beignets doused with powdered sugar eliminate
    much of the bitterness of the chicory.'

<p>Now begins the official Where conference. I spent the morning fixing up my demo for MapQuest (more on that later), grabbed some coffee (yay no Chicory ;), and now sitting in a huge room with lots of developers and very cool speakers.</p>
<p>I'll try and post various thoughts on speakers and talks as I get a chance. Better than putting them all in a single post.</p>
