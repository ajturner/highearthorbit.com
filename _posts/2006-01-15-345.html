<p><a href='http://kde.org/'>KDE</a>, a desktop environment for Linux <a href='http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1715'>will support the HTML Canvas element</a> in the next release (KDE 4). What does this mean to you, the user? The KDE Team's goal is to run <a href='http://apple.com/dashboard'>Apple Dashboard Widgets</a> on Linux!</p>
<p>Widgets themselves are nothing special. Having <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/software/indigowidget'>developed one</a> and dug through, modified, and working on more, they are just a collection of HTML and Javascript that happens to show up very nicely in a big dynamic webpage called <em>Dashboard</em></p>
<p>This will be nice since currently only <strike>Konfabulator</strike>Yahoo! Widgets are cross-platform.</p>
