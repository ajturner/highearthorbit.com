  content: "VPC is free, but not the Windows license. \r\n\r\nI know I'm not the only
    one who finds it odd that Microsoft will not update VPC to run on Intel chips.
    The last update was over a year ago, to fix incompatabilities with Tiger.\r\n\r\nVPC
    runs on G4 and G5 systems (not well, as you found out), but not on the latest
    and greatest.\r\n\r\nWhen I had it installed, I found that I rarely used it except
    to jump into a mapping program. If there's a work around, not matter how kludgy,
    I'm tempted to use the work around than enter the VPC world. \r\n\r\nSadly, I
    may have to purchase Parallels if only to run IE so that I can see the navigation
    frame of a website constructed with .Net frameworks. And that would be the only
    reason."

This isn't surprising, as there is now BootCamp and <a href='http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/'>Parallels Desktop for Mac</a>, yum, 2 os's at the same time. (via <a href='http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/07/18/a-virtually-free-pc/'>FactoryJoe</a>)</p>
<p>I've owned Virtual PC for 2 years now and ran it about 4 times when I first got it. It was too slow on my dual 1.8 G5. Go figure. :)</p>
