<p>Announced today, the World Bank is openly releasing all of their indicator data. Previously, the World Bank had provided an <a href="http://developer.worldbank.org/" title="World Bank - Welcome to the World Bank Developer Network!"><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a>, but the full data downloads is a welcome move in the realization that access to raw data can enable many possible projects and analyses that a simple interface cannot.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The World Bank's Open Data initiative is intended to provide all users with access to World Bank data. The data catalog is a listing of available World Bank data sources.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>It is clear that an organization as wide reaching and impactful as the Bank has a vast amount of data <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/data-programs" title="Data Programs | Data | The World Bank">across many organizations and groups</a>. Pulling these data together, normalizing, and sharing them is a noble, and well done, effort.</p>
<p><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Central-African-Republic-Data-The-World-Bank.png" width="200" height="114" alt="Central African Republic | Data | The World Bank.png" style="float:left; padding-top:5px; padding-right:5px; padding-bottom:5px;" />Besides just the data catalog, the World Bank has provided an excellent inspection by country and indicator for actually moving through the data without having to be a developer. For example, the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/central-african-republic" title="Central African Republic | Data | The World Bank">Central African Republic</a> demonstrates the depth of information on economics, social welfare, health, business development, and the environment.</p>
<p>I also believe I see the indelible fingerprint of the excellent work of <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/country/central-african-republic" title="Central African Republic | Data | The World Bank">Development Seed</a> on the design, and layout of a complex catalog of data, indicators, and communication. Having also worked with the World Bank on several projects, it's interesting to see a large, multinational organization embracing innovative tools, open data, and information sharing in the pursuit of global development. There are also some more great announcements coming in the future.</p>
