<p>Next Monday Where2.0 (well, Where2.2) starts. There are a lot of exciting things coming out and this week I'll be going through all the announcements of things I can talk about <em>before</em> the conference, and then afterwards the ones that are announced at Where.</p>
<p>I'll be giving a talk early on Tuesday <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/where2007/view/e_sess/11891" title="O'Reilly Where 2.0: Using and Enabling the Emerging GeoStack">Using and Enabling the Emerging GeoStack</a>, discussing the current trends on open geodata formats, sharing of information, mashups, and what any company, developer, and user can do to help build this stack to enable even better geospatial data integration. It can start as simple as using a WordPress blog with GeoPress for GeoRSS and KML syndication, to supporting Shapefile and WFS support with GML.</p>
<p>Don't worry, there will be lots of pretty pictures, and links to great demos. </p>

<p>So stay tuned for a lot of very cool new geo releases.</p>
