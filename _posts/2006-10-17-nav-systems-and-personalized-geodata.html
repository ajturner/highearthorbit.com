  content: "The 'benefits' of the Honda system are hard to discern. Most people will
    find that looking out the window gives them all the weather info required. As
    for flooding and snow-bound routes, it will of course depend on the inputs, not
    just some vague description of the weather provided by a national weather service.
    \r\n\r\nThe VW/Google system appears more useable at first blush, although
    again, I'd say that gas prices are not time-sensitive. I can look up and down
    a road and decide if I want to drive an extra 150 yds to save $0.01 per gallon.
    Again, it depends on the inputs, and there does not seem to be any discussion
    of those.\r\n\r\nWhile integration with a vehicle's interior or drive systems
    is not to be underestimated, I think you are overstating the benefits. Portable
    nav systems can interpolate distance, and continue to work even when out of satellite
    range. Remaining out of range for an extended period does cause problems, but
    it is rare that you would be without a signal for 10 miles, right?\r\n\r\nFinally,
    for those of us with (or about to be with) portable nav systems, the cost savings,
    ability to install after-market  entertainment components, retro-fitting to older
    cars, transportability to rental cars, and most important, interoperability with
    our Macs or PCs are strong arguments for a non-manufacturer nav system. Granted,
    Garmin's POI loader is not yet Mac compatible (!), but it is easier to upload
    and evalute travelling salesman-type challenges when you can connect your nav
    system directly to your home computer.\r\n\r\nI like that companies recognize
    much more can be done with these systems, but I think they'd be better off for
    now focusing on things that require an update every 6-12 months instead of 6-12
    minutes."

  content: "I should add two more things:\r\n\r\n1. You can hose the portable's entire
    file structure (less than 2 hrs of ownership -- New Record!) and then buy a new
    one, replaced the hosed files, and return the duplicate. Try <i>that</i> with
    a Prius.\r\n\r\n2. You can sit in the comfort of your own home drinking beer and
    watching football while tinkering. I suppose you could do that with a built-in,
    but I hear things get coolish in Detroit during October...\r\n\r\nMy main point
    is that we use these tools because people are fundamentally lazy. We could learn
    to fold a map, but there's a flashier (better?) way. We could just trust that
    one of the next exits will have a Steak 'N' Shake or Krusty Burger, but we'd rather
    look it up for sure. The problem is that the time sensitive information requires
    some type of updating action, and you can't always expect the people who have
    the information to update the information. Their motivations are different from
    the consumer's motivation, and neither party agrees on when the information is
    most useful.\r\n\r\nI think one of the most useful things about GeoRSS and GeoPress
    is that it packages and collates information that is readily available and provides
    it in a useful way that can be presented in a multitude of formats. Something
    like this could be integrated into nav systems, but you'll have to show the information
    suppliers that it is worth the extra cost.\r\n"

<p>Honda is showing off a new <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/en/news-12610-GPS%20with%20weather%20info%20and%20social%20networking%20system%20on%20Honda%20cars.html" title="Akihabaranews">GPS with weather info and social networking system</a> (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/17/honda-nav-system-offers-weather-user-submitted-poi-deets/" title="Endgaget article">via Engadget</a>). This is a lot like <a href="http://www.automotoportal.com/article/Volkswagen_and_Google_develop_revolutionary_navigation_system">Goole & Volkswagon's proposed nav system</a>.</p>
<p>What is really exciting is the ability to load up personal <abbr title="Points of Interest">POI</abbr >. For example, I am going on a road trip and want to get all my favorite restaurants, WiFi locations, friends' houses, and hiking trails for Michigan and sourthern Canada. This could be a GPX file, or <a href="http://georss.org" title="GeoRSS homepage">GeoRSS</a> feed from <a href="http://mapufacture.com" title="Mapufacture" rel="me">Mapufacture</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/nuvi/" title="Garmin Nuvi">Garmin Nuvi</a> supports this using their <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/poiloader/" title="GarmiN POI Loader">POI Loader</a>, which will take a GPX or CSV file and load it onto our GPS. The Nuvi looks really great, but is an external solution. Built-in navigation systems offer better integration into the interior and usually better sensors. For example, my Prius (Akius) has in-wheel hub sensors for integrating distance traveled when GPS isn't available. Now if only the in-car navigation systems (which cost a bundle more, on an order of magnitude) offered similar functionality, upgradeability, and best of all: hackability. </p>
