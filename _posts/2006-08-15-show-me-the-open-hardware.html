<p><a href='http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8030785497.html' title='Linux Devices Article: Trolltech woos developers with "open" Linux phone'>TrollTech announced an 'open' phone</a>, called the <em>Greenphone</em>. It runs Linux (<a href='http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS8500486718.html' title='Linux Devices: QTopia Platforms'>QTopia Phone Edition</a> specifically) </p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/qtopia_greenphone_front_and_back.jpg' title='QTopia GreenPhone'><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/qtopia_greenphone_front_and_back.thumbnail.jpg' alt='QTopia GreenPhone thumbnail' align='right' hspace='5px'/></a>It is a full-featured GPRS/GSM phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>dual-core 312MHz XScale processor</li>
<li>64MB Ram, and a mini-SD flash slot</li>
<li>1.3 megapixel camera
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li>WiFi networking</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Looking at the success <a href='http://nokia.com' title='Nokia Homepage'>Nokia</a> has had with <a href='http://opensource.nokia.com/'>exposing various developer interfaces</a> to their <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60' title='Python for Series 60 Sourceforge Project Page'>mobile phones</a> and <a href='http://www.maemo.org/' title='Maemo Homepage'>N770 tablet</a> (Maemo), I think there is a huge market for an "openphone". When I first heard of the <a href='http://www.oreillynet.com/etel/' title="O'Reilly Telephony Conference">O'Reilly Telephony Conference</a>, I pictured people sitting around with their <a href='http://www.asns14.dsl.pipex.com/index.shtml' title='The Old Telephone Company'>antiquated telephones</a>, talking about switchboards and the like. I guess it's a lot cooler scene than that. </p>
<p>Additionally, hopefully Open-hardware like mobile phones and tablets will kick the closed-minded carriers into realizing they're slowly strangling themselves by keeping everything closed and begin to work with the huge, untapped, hobbyist and developer community. </p>
