  content: "Andrew, if it weren't for you, our movement and now specifically our users
    and our data would not be what it is and what it can remain with us on hiatus.
    \r\n\r\nI appreciate this and believe very much in the importance of our previous
    work and your continued work. I think you have a shot at fusing lots of of data
    with better spatial analysis and keep plugging away at the RELEVANCE issue. You
    guys are doing very well and I'll continue to support however I can. I'm still
    reeling from the response of the news but will be pinging you soon to look at
    the future! Thank you, thank you. Di-Ann"

  content: "Andrew (and others @ GeoCommons), my gracious thanks go to you for hosting
    our user's data.\r\n\r\nPOI and map information, beyond the scope of checkins
    is hugely valuable to our world in general. I would argue ZERO (as in none) data
    is equally as important. As a fresh perspective, \"zero data\" is innate in exploring
    our world and letting us, as humans, discover our world and interpret it via our
    own value systems.\r\n\r\nI'm sad to see the current geo-realm go to checkins,
    or reviews (as with Yelp).\r\n\r\nThere is something inherent in geography which
    binds us, and it binds us in the sense that we, as humans, are very much alike
    and share the same spaces. \r\n\r\n--jake"

<p>Over four years ago, as I experimented with the emerging broad tools for location, mobile, and the web, Platial arose to be the new place to easily share location information. Utilizing the increasingly popular GoogleMaps platform they made it clear that people were going to engage in new and comfortable ways with geospatial technology.</p>
<p>I remember being impressed by <a href="http://platial.com/" title="Platial.com - Who and What's Nearby">Platial</a> and the goal of providing a way for anyone to easily annotate places that mattered to them.When I originally pitched the idea of a <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/neogeography">"Neogeography" book</a> to O'Reilly it was with the inspiration of Di-Ann's drive to citizen access to geospatial tools that I considered how people should be able to map their genealogy and share their trips.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://brainoff.com" title="Mikel Maron's Blog" rel="coworker">Mikel</a> and I built <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com/" title="mapufacture blog">Mapufacture</a>, we partnered with Platial on several projects. Platial had attempted to make a local information aggregator that never really took off, and so we discussed how to utilize the geospatial data aggregation platform in Mapufacture to provide and aggregate content for Platial. I even helped build and test the Platial developer API using the first iterations of AtomPub and OpenSearch, the results of which can now be seen in Mapufacture's and <a href="http://core.geocommons.com/help/Developer_API" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons' APIs</a>.</p>
<p>In looking at specifically the GeoWeb landscape, Platial definitely provided a necessary capability of easily allowing people to annotate and share locations. It is the more explicit version of more recent location-sharing tools such as FourSquare, BrightKite, or Latitude that merely ask where you are, not what's important to you. When Mapufacture was acquired by <a href="http://www.fortiusone.com/" title="FortiusOne Visual Intelligence Solutions | Visual Intelligence, Smarter Decisions">FortiusOne</a>, the combination of the large head of geographic data in <a href="http://geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons</a>, combined with the very long-tail of aggregated sensor and streaming information provided for mixing disparate datasources and understanding of context and relevance. Users want to collaborate around all types of data, and share insights, find out relevant information, share this with friends, family, coworkers, and their government.</p><br />

<p>Clearly geographic data is not merely limited to traditional map sources or cartographic outputs. Location is being integrated across all platforms and recognized as a primary component of any data. What differs is the means by which users will interact, create, and use this information depending on their needs, context, and capabilities.</p>
<p>As has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/01/social-mapping-startup-platial-finds-its-way-to-the-deadpool/" title="Social Mapping Startup Platial Finds Its Way To The Deadpool">widely</a> <a href="http://www.englishlearner.com/tests/reported_speech_quiz_1.shtml" title="Reported Speech 1">reported</a> by the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/03/01/interview-why-platial-shut-down-and-what-that-means-for-geo/?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=navigation" title="Interview: Why Platial Shut Down and What That Means for Geo '&ldquo; GigaOM">news</a>, GeoCommons is archiving the Platial user data and maps. Users can find their data by visiting the <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/source/platial" title="GeoCommons Finder!">GeoCommons Platial Source</a> page and searching for their username or maps and freely download them or build new maps and widgets. Along the way, perhaps users will also realize the capability of combining their personal information with relevant geographic data - because for example, you should know great surfing spots combined with wave heights and approved recreation areas.</p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://maker.geocommons.com/Wrapper.swf" width="100%" height="300px" id="maker_map_12436" style="visibility: visible;"><param name="base" value="http://maker.geocommons.com" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowNetworking" value="all" /><param name="flashvars" value="map_id=12436&amp;core_host=http://core.geocommons.com/&amp;maker_host=http://maker.geocommons.com/&amp;dev=false&amp;sharedLibraryPath=http://maker.geocommons.com/SharedLibrary.swf&amp;SWFMode=show" /></object><br /><br />
