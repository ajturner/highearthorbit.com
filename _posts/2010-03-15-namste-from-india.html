  content: Wasn't the Taj Ma Hal built for one woman?  I believe so.  What kind of
    special woman that must have been.  I mean, what do you say to something like
    that?  Thanks ;P

Corrie was presenting at the Indo-US Frontiers of Engineering Forum in Agra about her work on sustainable energy and policy. We're traveling from Agra, to Jaipur - the pink city, onto Varanassi along the spiritual Ganges river, and then to Delhi before heading back to Washington, DC.</p>
<p>It's been very enlightening so far. The best comparison we have made based on our experiences is that it is the density and working density of China, with hints of Kenya. There is such a vibrant buzz about daily life and activities, with a fervor for interaction, color, and food that permeates the entire social landscape.</p>
