<p>Today the democratic elections are occurring in Afghanistan. There is a <a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/" title="FrontlineSMS: A free, large scale text messaging solution for NGOs and non-profit organizations">FrontLine SMS</a> on the ground pulling in data into <a href="http://www.afghanistanalive.com/" title="Afghanistan Alive Magazine - the real picture of Afghanistan">Alive in Afghanistan</a>, which is running <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/" title="Ushahidi :: Crowdsourcing Crisis Information (FOSS)">Ushahidi</a>. </p>
<p>At FortiusOne, we're pulling together demographic, violence, and polling information into a dashboard of maps.</p>

<p> You can read more about it on USAID's <a href="http://globaldevelopmentcommons.net/node/2776" title="Join Our New Partnership to Monitor Election Related Violence in Afghanistan | Global Development Commons">Global Development Commons</a>, or how <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2009/08/10/camp-roberts-exercise-and-the-afghanistan-elections-creating-a-geo-stack-for-humanitarian-relief/" title="Camp Roberts Exercise and the Afghanistan Elections: Creating a Geo-Stack for Humanitarian Relief | Off the Map - Official Blog of FortiusOne">we're partnering</a> with numerous other projects to build out solutions like this for deploying to the field.</p>
<p>The compelling example here is the combination of demographic information with contextually relevant information (polling locations), realtime feeds of data, and user-generated, on the ground observations. Together they are helping provide a common picture into the complex relationships, consequences, and potential outcomes of the election might look like.</p>
