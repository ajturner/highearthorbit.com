There have been numerous great projects, collaborations, and work that have prevented me from taking the time to blog. As I've noted in the past, <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/twitter-means-reading-fewer-blogs/">Twitter defuses just enough of idea sharing</a> that I don't readily go to write articles. However, while these micro-messages relieve the immediate pressure of a concept they lack the general feeling of satisfaction that a more expressive and coherent article provides.</p>
<p>In quick summary of what I've been up to - as a means of providing a sort of excuse, preview, and immediate alleviating of the overwhelming feeling that "I haven't posted in a while, so it's difficult to start again":</p>
<p>Besides a <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/namste-from-india/" title="Namste from India :: High Earth Orbit">two week trip to India</a> with Corrie, I gave a plenary lecture at the Library of Congress on Neogeography and digital preservation of geospatial data that will soon be online, spoke at the UK Socio-Cultural workshop on the use of community and citizen generated geospatial data in crisis response and development work. There is also some hopefully soon news on new countries opening up data.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://fortiusone.com" title="FortiusOne homepage">FortiusOne</a> we've been fortunate to work with many great partners this Spring and Summer in providing open collaborative platforms that we'll soon be able to share with everyone. In addition, we've been heads down building out a host of new features to GeoCommons that will really open the GeoWeb and provide more than just visualization. We also participated in the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/60" title="OGC OWS-7 Request for Quotation">OGC testbed</a> that experimented with the sharing and annotation of authoritative and crowd-sourced data, much of the lessons and capabilities that are already exemplar in <a href="http://geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons</a>, but we'll be adding more features to enhance the interoperability.</p>
<p><a href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/" title="Greater Greater Washington">DC</a> continues to be an interesting place to live - and I've definitely had more exposure to government than I ever expected. The area is surprising in the innovation and connectedness that is definitely worth sharing.</p>
<p>While we're about to launch a number of new capabilities, I'm also able to come up for a bit more air. My aim over the next few months is to dramatically increase my posts. Consider this one as a way to poke through the shroud that will enable more regular posting.</p>
