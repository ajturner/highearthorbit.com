<p>I'm a fan of splimes - web-enabled, syndicated sensor-webs. What I find both hilarious, and ingenious, are these <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061031-gps-pigeon.html?source=rss">GPS-enabled, sensor-laden pigeons</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a project known as PigeonBlog, sensors in the backpacks collect data on toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as the birds wing through city skies.</p>
<p>The information is then sent back to a central computer, which automatically posts a map of the pollutants' concentration on the Internet.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The entire package costs just $250 USD and weighs 1.3oz. Not a bad size for distributing these to people to carry around as well. Apparently the sensor itself is a modified smoke detector. </p>
<p>Go check out <a href="http://www.pigeonblog.mapyourcity.net/" title="PigeonBlog">PigeonBlog</a></p>
