<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/PerensMozilla_Cover.jpg' alt='Bruce Perens\&#39; Mozilla Development Book' align='right' hspace='10px' vspace='10px'/>I remember seeing this a long time ago, but never got around to looking at them. However, when I was in the bookstore using one of the <a href='http://dealnews.com'>Borders 30% off coupons</a> I came across the <a href='http://www.phptr.com/promotion/1484?redir=1'>Bruce Perens' Open-Source Series</a> published by <a href='http://www.phptr.com'>Prentice Hall</a>.</p>
<p>All of the books in the series are released free of charge and open-source several months after their initial publication. I'm particularly interested in their <em>PHP 5 Power Programming</em> (coming up from PHP 4), and <em>Rapid Application Development with Mozilla</em>. I'm looking forward to the <em>Subversion Version Control</em> which was published in May and should be out any time now. </p>
<p>Check out the download links below each title. They also carry titles for programming in Qt, Samba configuration, Linux development and more.</p>
