<p><a href="http://esri.com" title="ESRI Homepage">ESRI</a>, one of the big names in GIS, presented some of their open <strong>services</strong> (as they were wont to use the word). These are many web tools for obtaining, viewing, and manipulating geographic data and were very impressive.</p>
<p>The first was an <a href="http://apps.arcwebservices.com/svgviewer/map.html" title="SVG Map Viewer">SVG Map Viewer</a>, which is a really cool utility for viewing maps in a browser. By using SVG, it can quickly reorganize the actual data such as changing map projection on the fly. You can also reorient, add/remove layers and other cool stuff.</p>
<p>The second was <a href="http://plasma.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine/index.html" title="National Geographic Map Machine">National Geographic's map machine</a> where you can investigate various layers of science and climatological data. </p>
<p>The next presentation was by a company <a href="http://www.inrix.com/" title="Inrix Homepage">Inrix</a>, which showed off some of the new technologies and techniques in traffic monitoring, traffic history, and <a href="http://www.inrix.com/techpredictive.asp" title="Inrix traffic prediction ">traffic prediction</a>. So their system would show you the current congestions, as well as the predicted future conditions based on historical conditions and also planned events (sports, concerts, etc.)</p>
<p>They're using the "Inrix Dust Network", which consists of sensored delivery trucks, service vehicles, and toll pass devices. Therefore they're constantly, almostly for free, gathering large sets of data. </p>
<p>Of course, not all these sensors and such are good. By use of toll sensors, <a href="http://news.com.com/E-tracking%2C%2Bcoming%2Bto%2Ba%2BDMV%2Bnear%2Byou/2010-1071_3-5980979.html" title="News.com story: E-Tracking coming to DMV">they will know where you are</a>. Now is the time to start putting in place and defining geo-privacy standards.<br />
