<p>As I posted on the <a href="http://georss.org/blog/2007/04/30/georss-site-rebooted-now-with-drupal/" title="GeoRSS Site Rebooted - now with Drupal">GeoRSS Blog</a>, we just recently relaunched the site using a CMS. Specifically, we're using Drupal because of its excellent support of geospatial standards (and being the one who did the migration, it was very easy to setup - there are definitely other <a href="http://my.joomla.free.fr/index.php?option=com_newsfeeds&catid=21&Itemid=40" title="Joomla GeoRSS library">great</a> <a href="http://www.midgard-project.org/" title="Midgard CMS">GeoCMS</a>s out there).</p>
<p>One of the main purposes behind moving to a more dynamic CMS was to involve the community in helping to document and forward the standard. Since there are now more people interested in GeoRSS, there have been lots of questions on format, examples, libraries, and so on that can now be easily added to the site. </p>
<p>In addition, there are typically very long discussions on email on adding new features to the standard. These usually get a really good discussion going, but then kind of fade out without any resolution. While it's good for a standard to be 'stable', it's not good for it to be 'stagnant' - or just overly frustrate people who are trying to extend it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're trying out a new process by which anyone can <a href="http://georss.org/proposals" title="GeoRSS Proposals">add a Proposal</a> for extension to GeoRSS. The community can comment and finally vote on it (any member of the community can vote, this means you too!). Even if the proposal is not accepted, the proposal remains as a central point of documentation of the discussion, decision, reasons, and how users implemented the standard for their own uses (you still need to finish your projects).</p>
<p>Then, if and when the proposed addition is accepted, the page can serve as documentation on how to migrate from the proposed format to the finally accepted format.</p>
<p>Anyways, hop on over to the new <a href="http://georss.org" title="GeoRSS homepage">GeoRSS Site</a>, let me know if you see anything 'funny' (e.g. missing images, dead links, etc.) and get yourself an account (they're free and come with a scoop of ice cream).</p>
