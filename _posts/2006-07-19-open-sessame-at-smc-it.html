  content: "Apparently the  open-sessame project : http://sourceforge.net/projects/spacecraft\r\nis
    no more active since may be  the 22 September 2004. I tried without success to
    compile it on Debian .\r\nIs this software now developped somewhere else ? Normally
    it should always be under the gnu free software licence."

<p>I have a poster at the <a href="http://smc-it.jpl.nasa.gov/" title="Space Mission Challenges Conference 2006 homepage">Space Mission Challenges in IT</a> conference hosted by NASA JPL. Unfortunately, I was unable to make it to the 4-day conference, despite it being an incredibly large number of amazing projects. </p>
<p>In my place, <a href="http://hoteldetective.org/" title="Katie Bechold LiveJournal: Hotel Detective" rel="collaboratesWith">Katie Betchold</a> has done a great job getting my rather large 3'x4' poster out there, hung up, and my in fact be presenting it today for the 2-minute poster precis. She is totally awesome!</p>
<p>If you don't, in fact, find yourself in Pasadena, California at the conference, then you can <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/publications/OpenSessame_SMC_Poster.pdf' title="Open-SESSAME 3'x4' poster for SMC-IT" rel="me">virtually check out my poster</a> (1.8 MB pdf). The accompyaning paper should be in a future IEEE publication available at local newstands everywhere. </p>
<p>The title of the paper is: "The Development and Use of Open-source Spacecraft Simulation and Control Software for Education and Research", and primarily covers the experiences of developing <a href="http://spacecraft.sf.net" title="Open-SESSAME Homepage" rel="me">Open-SESSAME</a> spacecraft modeling and simulation framework, its use at the <a href="http://www.sssl.aoe.vt.edu/" title="Space Systems Simulation Laboratory at Virginia Tech">Space Systems Simulation Laboratory at Virginia Tech</a>, and by various researchers around the world. </p>
