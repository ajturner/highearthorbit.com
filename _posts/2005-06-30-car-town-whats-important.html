<p>We're way excited to be getting an IKEA store in the Detroit area (say what you will about IKEA, but it's inexpensive, functional, and appealing in a modern/Scandinavian fashion sense). And of course, being the Detroit area, they give the following important stats on the <a href='http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=12&langId=-1&catalogId=10101&StoreName=canton'>Coming Soon!</a> page for the Canton Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acres: 20 (primary parcel)</li>
<li>Square Feet: 311,000</li>
<li>Parking Spaces: 1300</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>What was also suprising is that in Sweden (where they apparently call it <em>ik-ee-ah</em>), where cars are not that common, the IKEA store looks the <em>exact same</em>. Big Box with a huge parking lot and lots of cars. Of course, I would think carrying your new desk and bedroom set on the train would be somewhat... troublesome.</p>
