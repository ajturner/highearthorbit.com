  content: "Not that this is wrong, but coincidentally, Jon Gruber tackled this from
    the other side on the same day.\r\n\r\nhttp://daringfireball.net/2006/05/goal\r\n\r\nAtoms
    vs. Bits\r\n\r\nJust like in past membership drives, most of the revenue is coming
    from t-shirt sales. At SXSW this year, I spoke on a panel about making money from
    weblogs, and one of the main points I emphasized is that people are more willing
    to spend money for atoms than for bits. I.e. people will happily pay for things
    they can actually hold in their hands, but you can't touch
    ones and zeroes.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the reason you fine readers are
    buying these shirts is that you want to support my work, I don't
    think I'd be nearly as successful if I were only asking for
    donations or selling memberships.\r\n\r\nThis isn't criticism;
    it's just an observation about human nature. It's
    why so many honest people aren't at all reluctant to download
    bootleg media files from file-sharing services. I see it in myself, too. When
    The New York Times put their op-ed columnists behind a for-pay subscription service
    on their web site earlier this year, I was very reluctant to pay the $50 annual
    subscription fee even though I read their op-ed columnists, on the web, almost
    every single day of the year.\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference
    between The Times's TimesSelect system and my membership system
    at Daring Fireball, which is that I'm keeping all of my article
    content freely available to the public, whereas the only way to read The Times
    op-ed columnists is to pay for a TimesSelect account. I'm just
    pointing out that $50 a year isn't a lot of money for something
    I read at least 300 times per year &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; it works out to like 15
    cents a day &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; but yet I was reluctant to sign-up because it
    just didn't seem right to have to pay for something to read
    on the web."

<p><a href='http://mashable.com/2006/05/09/the-indiekarma-experiment/'>Mashable has some thoughts on micropayments</a>, in this case via <a href='http://www.indiekarma.com/'>indieKarma</a>. indieKarma pays you a penny for every hour a visitor spends on your site. Implementation seems weak, as it requires both the viewer and site to have accounts setup and logged in to indieKarma (e.g. won't work from public workstations)</p>
<p>Mashable states:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Does anyone really think that micropayments are a good idea? Paying one cent for every site I visit feels like a reading tax<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>I think micropayments are actually a great idea. Except for the web, we already pay a "reading tax" on everything: newspapers, magazines, books. We also pay a watching tax (except for network tv), a listening tax (either via ads, or buy your cd) and so on.</p>
<p><a href='http://flickr.com/photos/ajturner/143539017/'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/51/143539017_9cf32ef3b9_m.jpg' alt="Broken Newton - sweet victory!" align='right' hspace='5px'/></a>And micropayments shouldn't apply to just websites. Open-source software is used by individuals and companies who find value in the tool and in some cases make money. Yet in most cases the original developer(s) never see a single $0.01. I can speak for this myself. There have been over 7000 downloads (that I know of via the tracking stats I have) of one of my programs <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/software/dashsaver/'>DashSaver</a>. This includes being included in MacWorld UK, and a Japanese Mac magazine, and being very favorably reviewed several times on sites and podcasts. Guess how much money it's made me? (if you guessed anything other than $0.00, you were wrong - though if you guessed that it <em>did</em> win me a broken Newton Message Pad you'd be correct). </p>
<p>This doesn't really bother me. I like making software and tools that people find useful. However, I'm a little less inclined, and able, to make great tools/sites/stuff when it comes out of my free-time and I don't even have the option of making it my 'day job'. </p>
<p>The only ways someone can monetize, and therefore begin to properly support themselves and produce great content and software is via advertising. Advertising drives up the cost of goods, makes a site fugly, and also can have a driving impact on the content itself (see also Lobbying of governments by corporations).</p>
<p>Anyways, Micropayments seem like a pretty decent idea - just have yet to be implemented well. The only current means of doing payments easily and universally is via PayPal, which takes a good chunk of the change for itself. And indieKarma requires 1 hour of viewing for 1 cent? Personally, I rarely spend more than 10 minutes on a site, and that's for a good site. :) </p>
<p>So do what I do, if you like a site/resource, then make sure and give their advertisements a couple of clicks. Leave the windows open for awhile, and even click around and see what the advertiser has to offer. It's no money out of your pocket, takes a short amount of time, and you'll pay the site more than programs like indieKarma are offering.</p>
