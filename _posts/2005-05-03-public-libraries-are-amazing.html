<p>It's amazing how the public library system has (atleast in my <a href='http://northville.lib.mi.us/'>local area</a>) really caught up with technology and provide some excellent services.</p>
<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/RecordedBooksLogo.gif' alt='Recorded Books Logo'  align='right' hspace='10px' vspace='10px'/>I just found out a new service they offer: downloadable Audiobooks and eBooks. <a href='http://www.netlibrary.com/'>NetLibrary</a> is the actual provider of choice, </p>
<p>After a 10 second stop in my local library, I was able to quickly sign-up and now can enjoy over 750 downloadable audiobooks and 11,440 eBooks. And we're not talking just "US Constitution", or "20,000 Leagues under the Sea" (both good reads, btw), but commercially available material like <a href='http://www.stephenking.com/DarkTower/'>The Dark Tower</a> by Stephen King, andPortugese Irregular Verbs... oh wait. Anyways, you get the point.</p>
<p>Go to your local library and "Check it out" (and turn off that campy 'After School Special' soundtrack)</p>
