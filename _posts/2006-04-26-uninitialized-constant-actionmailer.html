  content: "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say - excellent excellent tip. I'd reinstalled
    Ruby about 4 times trying to get ActionMailer to work; and all along it was just
    this config error. Rats!\r\n\r\nWell, it's solved now - so thanks a bunch. "

  content: "I had it inside the block for rails 1.1.6 and it worked.  When I upgrade
    to 1.2.1, it stopped working.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be a big deal except that when
    it's outside that block, the testing environment cannot set mail delivery to :test,
    which means that all my unit tests try to send e-mail through the SMTP server.
    \ They fail because the email addresses are bogus and not even legal (a@a.com).\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas?"

    manually."

  content: "In Ruby a Class is just an object, usually these objects are assigned
    to constants, variables that start with an uppercase letter. So ActionMailer is
    a constant that contains an instance of Class, namely the ActionMailer class.
    Since ActionMailer hasn't been intialized you get a NameError : Uninitialized
    Constant.\r\n\r\nMakes perfect sense :)"

    by jumping out of the window 17 times in the last month.  Thank God I live and

<p>A word to the wise of rails developers. Hopefully this makes it to Google search, because when I looked it up, there wasn't an answer. </p>
<p>If you're configuring ActionMailer and you try to run the console and get the following messages:<br />
<code></p>
<pre>
[host]$ script/console<br />
Loading development environment.<br />
./script/../config/../config/environment.rb:41:NameError:<br />
  uninitialized constant ActionMailer<br />
/home/highearth/.gems/gems/actionpack-1.12.1/lib/action_controller/integration.rb:15:<br />
  NameError: uninitialized constant ActionController::Integration::Session::Test<br />
./script/../config/../config/../app/controllers/application.rb:3:<br />
  NameError: uninitialized constant ActionController::Base</p>
<p></pre><br />
</code></p>
<p>Make sure your ActionMailer configuration in your <code>config/environment.rb</code> file is <strong>after</strong> your <code>Rails::Initializer.run do |config|</code> block. </p>
