  content: "Ah! Wish I'd seen this two weeks ago, when I was in Chicago. The Field
    museum exhibit was interesting - from the map of Napoleon's march into (and out
    of) Russia, to Snow's map of Cholera deaths in London, to the famous Underground
    map, some of De Vinci's map, and others. Super cool for any map lover..  \r\n\r\nBTW,
    to add to your list, ZoneTag could take the GeoRSS and allow you to annotate your
    photos of the different attractions right after capture."

<p>I'm spending a couple of days in Chicago and wanted to visit a couple of the <a href="http://www.festivalofmaps.com/" title="Festival of Maps Chicago">Festival of Maps</a> exhibits. However, the only interface, as I mentioned before, is their flash map. Well, I wrote a small script to pull the information from their "printer-friendly" pages and generated this very useful <a href="http://mapsomething.com/demo/data/festival_of_maps.kml" title="Chicago Festival of Maps">Chicago Festival of Maps KML</a>. </p>
<p><iframe src ='http://mapufacture.com/feeds/1000650?viz=embed' height="420px" width='400px'></iframe></p>
<p>It's also available via <a href="http://mapufacture.com/feeds/1000650" title="Mapufacture - Chicago Festival of Maps feed">Mapufacture</a> if you want to embed the map in your blog, get the GeoRSS, or mix in with another map you may have for say, other events and sights in Chicago. </p>
<p>I imported the KML file into my GPS receiver - which is pretty cool, and <a href="http://mapufacture.com/about/mobile" title="Mapufacture Mobile">Mapufacture Mobile</a> lets me use my N95 to find nearby locations. The original KML even has the address and phone number as KML elements, although no KML parser I've run across makes us of that info... yet. The iPhone Maps application loads 'most' of the markers, but doesn't pull out the <em>phoneNumber</em> elements either.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither <a href="http://www.mgmaps.com/" title="Mobile GMaps - View maps from various sources on your mobile phone!">MGMaps</a> (using OpenStreetMap tiles) nor <a href="http://www.google.com/gmm/" title="Google Maps">GoogleMaps Mobile</a> let me pull in KML - MGMaps complains and GoogleMaps Mobile just doesn't have that bit of functionality. Perhaps they're both waiting for OGC-KML 'Mobile Profile' :)</p>
<p>Of course, a <a href="http://dash.net/" title="Dash: The only internet connected automotive GPS device">Dash</a> would be a really good fit for this KML as well. </p>
