<p>So I love me some Macs. I'm a switcher from a long-time DOS/Windows user 4.333 years ago (see sad tale of Jabberwocky). However, as much as I promote Mac OS X and all that is glorious about it, it is still not without its faults. </p>
<p><em>Snark</em> my dual 1.8G5 decides that he wants to shutdown <em>right now</em>, and there's no convincing him otherwise. Of course, he does tell me this in several languages, which is very considerate of him.</p>
<p>And when I finally force Snark come back to life, he greets me with useful bits of information</p>
<pre><code><br />
panic(cpu 0 caller 0x000A4754): attempt to interlock mutex (0x04AA9FD8) failed on mutex lock</p>
<p>Latest stack backtrace for cpu 0:<br />

<p>I'll get right on that.</p>
