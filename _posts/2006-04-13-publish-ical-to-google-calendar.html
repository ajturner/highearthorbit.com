  content: "I have the same problem as Colin, running Mac OS 10.4.6 and iCal 2.0.3.
    The calendar publishes fine and Google Calendar displays the events, but it doesn't
    seem to refresh the feed when the ICS file is updated with changes from iCal.
    It would be great if there were an automatic refresh button.\r\n\r\nOne problem
    I can think of with \"auto-updating\" or refreshing the ICS file is that Google
    Calendar will constantly be checking for an updated version, increasing the load
    on whatever server one uses to publish the ICS file. For instance I use icalx.com,
    and if thousands and thousands of requests are constantly coming from Google Calendar
    trying to refresh the ICS file, icalx.com will probably not be able to keep up
    with the demand (it's free... and I don't want to shut them down!).\r\n\r\nMaybe
    Google can offer to host the published ICS file itself? (Not the same as importing,
    because then you miss out on the auto-updates to reflect changes in your iCal
    calendar).\r\n\r\nThanks for the great tutorial, Andrew!"

  content: "Good point Ariel - though this kind of problem is commonly addressed by
    sites like Technorati, FeedBurner, etc. with RSS feeds in general. Google could
    accept a \"ping\" by a webdav server whenever the iCal has been updated. At that
    point, it would refresh its cache of your iCal.\r\n\r\nThough the simplest solution
    is for Google to just ping the iCal for it's Updated value in the feed. If the
    value is newer than Google's cached copy, then it retrieves the entire calendar
    file.  (see <a href='http://www.httpsniffer.com/http/1426.htm'>If-None-Match</a>)"

    iCal and only use the Google calendar. This will synch based on your settings
    (by time or manually).\r\n\r\nI removed my work and home calendars after exporting

  content: Does this work with Windows (publishing from iCal to a Windows Google calendar?)
---
<p>Let me attempt to redeem my prior remarks about Google Calendar by offering this bit of how to publish your iCal (via <a href='http://www.apple.com/ical/ '>iCal</a> or <a href='www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html'>Mozilla Sunbird</a>) to Google. This was inspired by <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2006/04/13/howto-subscribe-to-a-google-calendar-using-ical/#comments'>How to subscribe to Google Calendar in iCal</a>.</p>
<h3>Create your calendar</h3><br />
You have numerous options for creating your calendar: <a href='http://www.apple.com/ical/ '>iCal</a> (Mac), <a href='www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html'>Mozilla Sunbird</a> (Mac, Windows, Linux), <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/outlook2ical/'>Outlook2iCal</a> (Windows), etc. </p>
<h3>Setup a public server to host your calendar</h3><br />
You have several options to publish your iCal calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.apple.com/dotmac/'>Apple .Mac</a> provides iCal hosting, but costs $$ (or &Acirc;&pound;, &acirc;&sbquo;&ordf;, &aring;&oelig;&ldquo;, &iuml;&middot;&frac14;, etc.)</li>
<li><a href='http://www.umdnj.edu/webctweb/design/webdavhowto.html'>Setup WebDav</a> on your own server to host calendars</li>
<li><a href='http://icalx.com'>iCal Exchange</a> is a free calendar sharing host</li>
<li><a href='http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20051020063242208&query=webdav'>Just FTP/Automator</a> your iCal file to a public server</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3>Publish your calendar</h3><br />
Using one of the prescribed methods above, you will then want to actually publish your calendar to the host (or upload via FTP/SSH/SFTP/carrier pigeon on 5.25" floppy disk). You can turn on "Publish Changes Automatically" to have your changes on your computer automatically uploaded to Google Calendar.</p>
<h3>Subscribe to your calendar in Google Calendar</h3><br />
Do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manage Calendars</li>
<li>then under "Other Calendars", click "Add calendar"</li>
<li>Fill in the URL of your published calendar - this is probably supplied by the hosting server (like iCal Exchange, .Mac, or you can figure it out for your own server)</li>
<li>Click "Ok" and wait a little bit for it to be uploaded</li><br />
</ol><br />

<p><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/Subscribe.jpg' alt='Subscribe to the Calendar'  hspace='5px' vspace='5px'/></p>
<h3>Bask in the warming, glowing warmth...</h3><br />
You're now done and have a Google Calendar version of your local iCal calendar. Unfortunately, at this point, Google Calendar doesn't let you edit this "public" calendar, though you can add events from this calendar to one of your Google Calendar calendars (if that makes sense, you're astute). Now you can just publish when you'll be available to stop at the local pub for a brew!</p>
