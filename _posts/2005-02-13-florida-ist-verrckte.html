<p>After having been in Ft. Lauderdale for 2 hours, I can still say, "Florida is crazy."</p>
<p>Of course, I mean that in a nice way. But the number of tropical print shirts, shorts in February, and '3-for-1' drink offers just makes me have great concern for the relative importance the 'state' carries.</p>
