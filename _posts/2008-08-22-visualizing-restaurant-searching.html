<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2008/08/24-hours-of-urbanspoon-on-the-iphone.jpg"><img src="/assets/uploads/2008/08/24-hours-of-urbanspoon-on-the-iphone-tm.jpg" width="350" height="265" alt="24 hours of Urbanspoon on the iPhone" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a> One of the simplest, most useful, and well executed applications on the iPhone is <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/blog/27/Urbanspoon-on-the-iPhone.html" title="Urbanspoon Blog | Urbanspoon on the iPhone">UrbanSpoon's free restaurant finder</a>. Open the application, it geolocates you, give the iPhone and shake and three Slot machine style selectors spin around and randomly choose a restaurant nearby. You can then even lock in specifics such as location, cuisine, or price range and shake to give more suggestions.</p>
<p>However, what's particularly neat about the application is that UrbanSpoon has been recording these "shakes" by location (inherent in the API call obviously) and created a great <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/iphone/24hours" title="24 hours of Urbanspoon on the iPhone">visualization showing the locations around the US</a> over a day of "shaking".</p>
<p>The heatmap essentially shows the evolving enquiry of people looking for a place to eat. There isn't an actual time display or timeline slider to investigate - but I imagine there are interesting trends during meals, and particularly after normal eating times when people don't have a plans on where to eat. In addition, a timezone lag that would show shaking progressing east to west.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sifra/reality-mining-nathan-eagle/" title="Reality Mining (Nathan Eagle)">Context mining of mobile devices</a>, combined with geographic location - and especially via <em>inferred</em> geographic information instead of directly <em><a href="http://fantomplanet.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/goodchild-on-vgi-and-other-stuff-at-redlands/" title="Goodchild on VGI and Other Stuff at Redlands &Acirc;&laquo; FANTOM PLANET">volunteered</a></em> information can yield interesting trends on ambient behaviors. Imagine if <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/" title="Charlotte Restaurants | Restaurant menus, reviews and maps on urbanspoon.com">UrbanSpoon</a> could also collect the number of people in the group by detecting other repeatedly seen nearby bluetooth/wifi devices, previous meals of the day, and the ultimate destination and distance to the chosen restaurant.</p>
