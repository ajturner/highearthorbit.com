<p>So I'm a long-time Primus fan. Don't hold it against me. I blame the influences of several childhood friends. I started out not being able to listen to them, and then slowly got into the groove. I got to see them perform at Tower Theater in Philadelphia back somewhere around 1995, and haven't purchased an album since <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=109379&originStoreFront=143441'>'Tales From the Punchbowl'</a>. </p>
<p>Well, driving past the Royal Oak Theater I saw <a href='http://www.c2b3.com/'>"Colonel Claypool - Sept 27"</a>. It's actually <a href='http://www.lesclaypool.com/ccbbb/'>Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains</a>. </p>
<p>The Theater is right next to work, so I have to go. I started looking around and have seen a bunch of good stuff, including <a href="http://www.primuslive.com/">Primus Live Downloads</a>.</p>
