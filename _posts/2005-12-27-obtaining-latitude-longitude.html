  content: Ah yes, I had forgotten about Multimap. It's great because it was one of
    the few searchable maps that was both world-wide and included lat/lon.

<p>I use several techniques for getting the latitude and longitude of a location. It depends on what info I have available:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Geeky</em> - requires some forethought, batteries, and sky. Use a GPS receiver (esp. something slick like a <a href="www.delorme.com/bluelogger/default.asp">Bluelogger</a> or <a href="www.navizon.com">Navizon</a>) to store your waypoints and tracks.</li>
<li><em>Quick & easy</em> - if you're in the US, use a geocoder, like <a href="http://geocoder.us">geocoder.us</a>. It only requires an address, location, city, state and you're done. It would even be easily automatable (lots of people do this).</li>
<li><em>Slick but tedious</em> - works anywhere in the world: <a href='http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1706'>gmap_extras</a> <a href="greasemonkey.mozdev.org">greasemonkey</a> script for <a href='http://mozilla.org'>Firefox</a> adds latitude and longitude to <a href="http://maps.google.com">GoogleMaps</a>. Unfortunately, Google keeps changing their layout which breaks the Greasmonkey scripts.</li>
<li><a href="maps.nationalgeographic.com/topo/">National Geographics' Topo!</a> is a little overkill, and <strong>very</strong> clunky interface. It is obviously a straight-port from Windows. In fact, the box and menus all say that you can export to Palm or PocketPC, but after lengthy discourse with National Geographic (well, <a href="http://topics-ent.com">Topics Entertainment</a>) it was verified that this was not the case. Still, very details latitude, longitude, and altitude</li><br />
</ul></p>
