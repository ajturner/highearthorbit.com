<p>Last reminder, proposals for the O'Reilly Where2.0 conference are due December 3. So make sure and get your submissions in!</p>
<p>The 'topic' this year is "Location is Relative". Claus Dahl said it best during his presentation on Imity two years ago: "It's not the fact that I'm *here* at this hotel, it's the fact that I'm surrounded by all of you that makes this location important" (paraphrased)</p>
<p>Are you buiding a business based on proximity? How about hyperlocal search and collaborative routing? It's not enough to assume your users are driving a car and want to get from A to B the 'fastest'. Maybe they want to go the greenest/prettiest/easiest/funnest (ok, that's not a word). How does someone find out what's interesting around them? Whether it's a concert, friends, construction, transportation, or shops?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teleatlas.com/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/ta_ct015682.swf" title="TeleAtlas Finalist: Slifter">Two</a> of the <a href="http://developer.where.com/jin/devcontest.jin" title="WHERE contest finalists: Yokel">finalists</a> in the latest LBS contests both included "find products near me", and Dash networks demoed a similar functionality coming up in their internet connected PND. But what's the next step with "near me" search?</p>
<p>PND's advertisements are ubiquitous this Christmas shopping season. Nearly every "Black Friday" circular sported a Garmin, Miro, Magellan, or other Navigation aid on the front page. Why this new rise in public interest of GPS? What will be hot next Christmas?</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing is getting hot - OpenStreetMap led the way in large-scale community driven mapping, but now both TomTom and Googleallows you to submit corrections. Where is that data going and how to you enable community-mapping?</p>
<p>Where2.0 next year will also feature a day of tutorials. So if you have some new tools or techniques you want to share, you should submit a proposal to teach other attendees about it. </p>
