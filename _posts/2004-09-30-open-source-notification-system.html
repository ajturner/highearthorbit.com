<p>There is a group that's made a pretty decent site on tracking other open-source project development. <a href="http://cia.navi.cx/">CIA Open Source Notification System</a></p>
<p>It seems to encapsulate developer progress & source progress very well, rather than bouncing to different source repositories.</p>
