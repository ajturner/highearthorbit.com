<p>It's been <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/11/where-20-2009-cfp-is-open.html" title="Where 2.0 2009 CFP Is Open - O'Reilly Radar">mentioned</a> elsewhere - but wanted to remind you to work on your <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/cfp/45" title="Where 2.0 2009 Call for Participation: Where 2.0 Conference 2009 - O'Reilly Conferences, May 19 - 21, 2009, San Jose, CA">Where2.0 proposals</a> over the US Thanksgiving Holiday. They are due on Monday.</p>
<p>Each year Where2.0 has demonstrated the migration of location technology from the bleeding edge and locative media art to mainstream businesses and practices. Yet we have just begun to realize the potential. Where2.0 is the conference to hear the newest announcements, learn from experts in the industry, and meet and collaborate on new projects and ventures.</p>
<p>I know people out there are doing amazing work on bringing advanced climate change analysis coupled with user-contributed data to pinpoint carbon emissions or the changing migratory paths of endangered species, repurposing outdated mobile phones for biological sensors, application of geospatial tools to community building, humanitarian and disaster response and citizen media, immersive, augmented reality through wearable and interactive devices - and of course the holy grail, how to realize a viable business plan amongst all this great potential.</p>

You'll find it difficult to find such an absorbed and forward thinking crowd to share your work with.</p>
