<p>O'Reilly is hosting and pushing their new <a href='http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/'>OpenBooks</a>, which are all of their books that are either open-source, and/or out of date. Many of these books have been available for awhile, such as <a href='http://books.mozdev.org/chapters/index.html' title='Creating Applications with Mozilla website'>Creating Applications with Mozilla</a> and <a href='http://svnbook.red-bean.com/' title='Version Control with Subversion website'>Version Control with Subversion</a>, aka the red-bean book. </p>
<p>There are also some oddities like <a href='http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beosprog/book/'>Programming the Be Operating System</a>. Yay old skool.</p>
