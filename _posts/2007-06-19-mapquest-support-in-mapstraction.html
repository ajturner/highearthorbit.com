<p><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mapquestlogo.thumbnail.png" align="right" hspace="5px" alt="MapQuest Logo"/>You may have noticed at my Where talk - or seen it mentioned elsewhere, but it's a big deal, so I wanted to make note of it here. </p>
<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mapstraction_mapquest.png" target="_new" title="Mapstraction MapQuest screenshot"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mapstraction_mapquest.thumbnail.png" align="right" hspace="5px" alt="Mapstraction - MapQuest"/></a>We're pleased to announce that Mapstraction now has built-in support for MapQuest Maps. MapQuest has long been a trusted provider of online maps, and now you can use them in any site that uses Mapstraction. You can see the demo and code here: <a href="http://mapstraction.com/demo.php?map=mapquest">MapQuest Mapstraction Demo</a></p>
<p>To let you know - if you haven't used Mapstraction before, the only modification you have to make to your map code is:</p>
<p><code>var mapstraction = new Mapstraction('mapstraction',<span style="color:red;">'mapquest'</span>);</code></p>
<p>and your marker, polyline, user interface, and everything else keeps on working. No muss, no fuss - switching API's is easy. So stop learning each provider specific API. </p>
<p>And if you're worried about losing specific functionality in a particular mapping API - you can always get the actual mapping object out of Mapstraction and make provider specific calls. Mapstraction aims to be a common API to the general functionality of the providers. Fortunately, they're all very busy adding new features all the time to keep up with one another, so along the way Mapstraction gets better too. </p>
<h3>More than just maps</h3><br />
What's really exciting (besides another major mapping provider being in Mapstraction) is that MapQuest has excellent geocoding and routing API's. Something Mapstraction didn't have. Well, now it does.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mapstraction.com/geocode.php?geocoder=mapquest&map=mapquest">Mapstraction geocoding using MapQuest</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mapstraction.com/route.php?router=mapquest&map=mapquest">Mapstraction routing using MapQuest</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>To support this, Mapstraction added mapstraction-geocode.js and mapstraction-route.js libraries. These are in addition to the usual mapstraction.js. So if you don't want routing or geocoding, you can leave these out. </p>
<p>Using Mapstraction, you can even switch between services. You can have <a href="http://mapstraction.com/geocode.php?geocoder=google&map=google">Google geocoding</a>, or <a href="http://mapstraction.com/geocode.php?geocoder=mapquest&map=mapquest">MapQuest geocoding</a> with just a single flip of provider. </p>
<p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mapstraction_polylines.png" target="_new" title="Mapstraction Polyline screenshot"><img src="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/mapstraction_polylines.thumbnail.png" align="right" hspace="5px" alt="Mapstraction Polylines"/></a>Mapstraction supports all the cool bits of the MapQuest API you probably didn't know about, such as <a href="http://mapstraction.com/demo-polylines.php">polylines</a>.</p>
<p>Currently the MapQuest Advantage API is supported, so you have to be a customer of MapQuest. That's part of the real benefit here with Mapstraction. You can take an existing website or application, try out the Advantage API with no modification of your code, and switch back if you're not happy with it. We're also hoping MapQuest has a re-release of their OpenAPI in the near future so that developers can use the free MapQuest API for their projects. </p>
