<p>Hit up the <a href='http://www.detroitbeerco.com/'>Detroit Beer Co.</a> this evening. Sampled some of their frosty beverages after having a hearty meal in nearby Greektown.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Local 1529 I.P.A.</h2><br />
This India Pale Ale is aggressively hopped and has intense maltiness. High hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Medium fruitness with relatively high alchohol. Medium body, light amber color.<br />
</blockquote><br />
A good description, maybe low fruitness rather than medium. Also, the high alchohol is very pronounced by a esthery taste at the end of the sample. I definitely enjoyed the very high hop factor, but I'm not sure I'd return due to the high alchohol aftertaste.</p>
