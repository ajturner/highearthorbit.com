  content: I think this is great.  If there is a geospatial track it will definitely
    be worth the 4 hours from WV.  Keep an eye on Pittsburgh which seems to have a
    few conferences in the next year or so.

  content: "I'm on the organizing committee for CodeMash, and I was perusing the SE
    Ruby site tonight to see if I could recruit some speakers.  I should have done
    this before (ah, but we're all volunteers!).\r\n\r\nPLEASE, COME!  SPEAK!  The
    entire goal of this conference is for us to all learn from one another.  It's
    definitely not .NET-centric.  We have Bruce Eckel and Neal Ford coming, in addition
    to Scott Guthrie (all doing keynotes).  We have Owen Taylor and Chris Judd doing
    Java talks.  Kevin Dangoor and Mark Ramm have promised TurboGears talks.\r\n\r\nGet
    those abstracts in ASAP.  I will make sure that the deadline is extended a bit,
    but PLEASE get them in as soon as you possibly can.  We're selecting talks now.\r\n\r\n--
    Dianne"

  content: Unfortunately, I will just be flying back from my 4 week wedding/honeymoon
    in NZ, so I don't think I'll be in a position to speak. But I definitely wanted
    others out there to know about it. I'm sure it will be a great conference!

<p>A 'local' conference, <span class="vevent"><a class="url summary" href="https://www.codemash.org/default.aspx" title="Codemash homepage">CodeMash</a>, is coming up in <span class="adr location"><span class="city">Sandusky</span>, <span location="region state">Ohio</span>, about 3 hours south of me, <span class="dtstart" title="2007-01-18">January 18</span>-<span class="dtend" title="2007-01-20">19</span></span>. There aren't many Midwest conferences (actually, not many non-San Francisco conferences), so get it while the goings good.</p>
<p>I just saw this today from a pointer by <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/">Pat Eyler</a>, and <a href="https://www.codemash.org/default.aspx">Call for Speakers</a> is due tomorrow. It's looks very .NET focused, which means that you should go and push the underdogs! </p>
