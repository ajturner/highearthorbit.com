<p><a href="http://gutenkarte.org/">Gutenkarte</a> was an amazing thing to see, mapping the locations <em>within</em> a book. However, it is only able to map and share public domain material.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/01/books-mapped.html">GoogleBooks supports</a> mapping of locations mentioned in books they've archived. See <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1741041929&id=ocpUNTtX0-IC&dq=lonely+planet+USA">Lonely Planet USA</a> for the locations mentioned in this travel guide. A great way to preview what locations the book focuses on and covers. (via <a href="http://hobu.biz/">hobu</a>, via <a href="http://zcologia.com/news/344/maps-for-google-book-search/">import cartography</a>)</p>
<p>Or for fictional books, such as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0060593083&amp;id=1il9_fsl7CYC&amp;dq=quicksilver">Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver</a> it can help you decipher what happened where.</p>
<p>Google has the benefit of being able to store and share the text for currently copyright material, which is a definite benefit. But the integration of maps really adds to the information and understanding of the material.</p>
