<p>The newer, more full-featured kid on the embedding Maps-in-your-Rails-App-block has gotten an update. <a href='http://thepochisuperstarmegashow.com/2006/07/08/ym4r-051/' title='YM4R v0.5.1 release announcement'>YM4R v0.5.1</a> was released a couple of days ago. It's now mostly a plugin, instead of a gem, since it includes a lot of Rails specific stuff. There are Ruby libraries for creating GoogleMaps tiles, and geocoding that are still in the gem, which is great too.</p>
<p>And I've even done my part to contribute by submitting my GeoRSS Simple Parser. </p>
