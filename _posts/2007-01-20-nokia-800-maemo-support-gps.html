  content: "The most exciting thing about the nokia linux (gnome) internet tablet
    are not the linux but, but part of the gnome stack included with it. Telepathy,
    and soon GeoClue, and so on.\r\n\r\nI was there at the Boston summit in the fall
    of '06 and was in on some of the workshops, some pretty wild ideas those dudes
    have.\r\n\r\nI have no clue how much progress they made on it so far... but I
    can't wait for that to be part of the stack."

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/01/nokia-n800.thumbnail.jpg" title="Nokia N800 Internet Tablet" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/>At CES this year, Nokia released the <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n800/">N800</a>, an updated version of the developer friendly <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/770">N770</a> internet tablet. They incorporated some of the feedback from users for more memory, a built-in camera, stand, and speakers/microphone.</p>
<p>What is most interesting (to me) is the built-in support for GPS and location devices in the N800 OS, <a href="http://www.maemo.org/">Maemo</a>. Maemo is based on Debian Linux, and the GPS support is done by building in <a href="http://gpsd.berlios.de/">gpsd</a>, the location-daemon. gpsd provides a common interface for location-based applications to access to the GPS information via the low-level service. Therefore, when you connect your Bluetooth GPS device to the N800, gpsd provides the location to any and all apps that may request it, like <a href="http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/" title="MaemoMapper">MaemoMapper</a> or <a href="http://maemo-hackers.org/wiki/MaemoBlog" title="MaemoBlog">MaemoBlog</a> to publish to geographic blogs via GeoRSS XML-RPC.</p>
<p>There is detailed information available from Maemo.org, <a href="http://maemo.org/maemowiki/HowToUseGPSFrameworkInOS2007" title="Maemo.org: HowTo use GPS framework in OS2007">HowTo use GPS framework in OS2007</a>. </p>
<p>I would argue that it would have been better to just include a GPS chip in the device itself. Currently an external device is required to be purchased and connected to use the location information - not something a typical user would do whenever they are traveler or quickly use the device out and about. </p>
<p>A better possibility would be to incorporate WiFi geolocation, such as <a href="http://loki.com/">Skyhook's Loki</a>, to provide location information over gpsd by the visibility of WiFi access-points. This would work much better in urban areas anyways where WiFi could be more visible than GPS signals.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hopefully getting my hands on one and see about geolocating the N800 camera images and WiFi/GPS/Cell tracking.</p>
