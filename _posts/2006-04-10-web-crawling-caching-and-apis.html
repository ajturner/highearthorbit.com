<p>Several of the projects I'm currently working on involve harvesting (mashing, grazing, retrieving, etc.) data from other websites. The web has recently (last 2-3 years) made vast amounts of data readily available via API's or simple spiders/harvesters. This is more recently been made apparent by the <a href='http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/'>huge number</a> of <a href='http://www.housingmaps.com/'>mashups</a> that have shown up (including <a href='http://whereihadmyfirstkiss.com'>one of my own</a>).</p>
<p>With the large number of mashups, even to the point of seeking <a href='http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/04/3finance.html'>venture capital funding</a>, one needs to wonder as to the real value involved. As a ZDNet article points out in <a href='http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=128'>Mashups: who's really in control?</a>, the developers of these mashups haven't necessarily added unique value, but provided a path to lead the original data providers or other larger entities to move in and provide a better solution.</p>
<p>Of course, then you actually see the purchase of <a href='http://del.icio.us'>del.icio.us</a>, GeoBloggers developer Daniel Catt, Platial, et al. You realize that mashups are actually viable. But, as pointed out on a recent Wired podcast as well as Joel Spolsky talk, "Do What you Love".</p>
<p><a href='http://www.programmableweb.com/'>ProgrammableWeb</a> is an excellent resource listing 192 available API's (and reports that there are approximately 2.78 new mashups per day). Some of these services, such as <a href='http://www.vast.com/contact/api.htm'>Vast</a>, are created purely <strong>as</strong> data providers.  (via <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/vast-&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;-aggregating-listings-from-the-whole-web/'>TechCrunch</a>). They provide great REST interfaces, and many have wrappers written in your favorite language (and if it isn't, perhaps its time you got a new favorite language). </p>
<p>While many services provide excellent API's, sometimes you just need to go old fashion and farm the data yourself, in this case, find yourself something like a <a href='http://warrenseen.com/blog/2006/02/24/ruby-web-spider-watch-this-space/'>Ruby Spider</a>.</p>
