<p>There is a program: <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">ipodder</a> which handles automatically downloading media to your iPod via an RSS stream. Your streams are updated as any newsfeed would be, but media content can be embedded in the stream via a link in an <enclosure> element in the xml file. </p>
<p>So, for example, you could subscribe to a news stream that every evening you would automatically download the news videos, clips, and say new artist releases, ready to be put on an ipod or watched with no wait (since it was already downloaded).</p>
<p>I wonder how this can be tied into SpyTrack? Again, an RSS stream that includes the icbm:latitude tags. The user info would bring up the downloaded media, so you could, say see a map of music releases from around the world, and then click the user to listen to the stream, or watch the video of news from around the world.</p>
