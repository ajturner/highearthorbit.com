<p>So the <a href='http://opengeospatial.org'>Open Geospatial Consortium</a> has formes an <a href='http://www.opengeospatial.org/functional/?page=ols'>OpenLS (Location Services)</a> Initiative. Essentially a suggested standard for merging geospatial data with telecommunication resources and digital data. Sam Bacharach (email on site) invites YOU to become part of the solution. </p>
<p>I agree that there can/should be a standard for this. However, I guess the difficult question is: "Who Decides"? The OGC appears to be a large body of people generating documentation. While that is all well and good to have your y's crossed and your o's dotted (or somesuch) it still requires the standards embodied by those ledgers of the digital domain to be implemented and actively supported by developers, groups, and <gasp>companies</gasp>.</p>
