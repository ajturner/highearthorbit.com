<p>I've been rapidly prototyping and developing a lot of Ruby on Rails applications. I don't want to run lots of WebBrick servers, or configure lighty. I'd rather just use apache for local development, which is much quicker and doesn't involve ports, and explicitly running stand-alone servers.</p>
<p>The instructions below are the quick, and bare-bones steps needed to get a rails app up for development on a Mac OS X machine. </p>
<h3>Create your rails application</h3><br />
<code>$ rails ~/Projects/myapp</code></p>
<h3>Edit your apache config file</h3><br />
You need to setup your apache to know how to handle the <em>/myapp</em> URL request. Put the following at the bottom of your <em>httpd.conf</em> file.</p>
<p><em>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf</em></p>
<pre><code><br />
FastCgiServer /Users/username/Projects/myapp/public/dispatch.fcgi<br />
    -idle-timeout 120 -initial-env RAILS_ENV=development -processes 1<br />
Alias /myapp/ "/Users/username/Projects/myapp/public/"<br />
Alias /myapp "/Users/username/Projects/myapp/public/"</p>
<p><directory /Users/username/Projects/myapp/public/><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Order allow, deny<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow from all<br />
</directory><br />
</code></pre></p>
<h3>Restart Apache</h3><br />
After you've edited the file, you need to restart apache:<br />
<code>$ sudo apachectl graceful</code></p>
<h3>Set the rails base address</h3><br />
Now you need to let rails know what the base address is for the URL's:<br />
<em>~/Projects/myapp/public/.htaccess</em><br />
<code><br />
RewriteBase /myapp<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Test that it works</h3><br />
Navigate your browser to <em>http://localhost/myapp</em>, and you should see the happy <strong>Welcome aboard</strong></p>
