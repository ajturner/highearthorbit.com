<p>In deference to the title of this blog, my consulting company, and my profession - Happy Space Race Day! Today marks the <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jj1EL1p0CjbFMmLfcH2r3uBkNNPgD8S2J63O0" title="The Associated Press: Russia Marks Sputnik Launch Anniversary">50th anniversary of the Sputnik</a> launch - proving that we could achieve at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit" title="Low Earth orbit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Low-Earth Orbit</a> (and that it wasn't full of scary <a href="http://www.tohokingdom.com/web_pages/lost_projects/space_monsters.htm" title="Godzilla vs. the Space Monsters: Earth Defense Directive">space monsters</a>)</p>
<p>Of course, besides very brief forays to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" title="Moon - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">nearby</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" title="Mars - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">celestial</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_missions" title="Space exploration - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">bodies</a> we have relegated ourselves to primary the same orbit we reached 50 years ago. </p>
<p>Here's to hoping we have the vision and execution to go back to deeper space - both for knowledge and to spread ourselves into more than one basket. :)</p>
