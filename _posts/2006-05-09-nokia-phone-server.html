  content: After 4 months more or less intensive testing with Nokia N70 + Raccoon
    mobile webserver + some home made python applications  it seems that the battery
    consumption is still on too high level. It would be nice to have something like
    this but it really needs some focused optimization

<p>Nokia has released their open-source <a href='http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/mobile-web-server/phone-software'>mobile phone server</a>. It's running Apache, which seems kind of heavy-handed for an embedded web-server, but definitely full-featured. </p>
<p>Combine a local mobile webserver with the <a href='http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini'>Opera Mini</a> or Full Opera web browser makes for rapid development of nice phone applications.</p>
<p>They even offer some nice suggestions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Interactive, Context and Location Dependent Content</p>
<p>These demonstrate that a website on a mobile phone is not just like any other website that simply happens to be on a mobile phone, but that it enables functionality that in the context of regular stationary websites is largely meaningless.</p>
<p>    * Remote interactive picture taking.<br />
    * Use the phone as a webcam.<br />
    * Find other mobile web sites in the proximity.<br />
    * Find out the location of a mobile website (cellid).<br />
</blockquote></p>
