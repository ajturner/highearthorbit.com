Today there is a '<a href="http://wc5280hack.pbworks.com" title="wc5280hack [licensed for non-commercial use only] / WhereCamp 5280 Unofficial Programmers meetup">hackfest</a>' at CU Denver Campus, then on Friday a full day of discussion, brainstorming and defining the future of geo.</p>
<p>It's almost half-way between Where2.0 and WhereCamp5280 is stacked to be an interesting discussion of the current state of affairs in what has been called <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/01/10/2010-year-of-location/" title="Will 2010 Finally Be the Year of Location?: Tech News &Acirc;&laquo;">"the year of location"</a>. And given the cadre of people that will be coming to WhereCamp5280, such as Waze, MapQuest, WeoGeo, Safe, Google, USGS, ESRI, numerous other geo-geniuses, and of course, a <a href="http://www.maploser.com/" title="Maploser exploring the where of geonerd." rel="coworker">cadre</a> of <a href="http://www.andreit.com/" title="GeoComrade - I write about maps, geo, location, startups etc'&brvbar;">FortiusOne</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/cwhelm/" title="">engineers</a> - we definitely should have some fascinating discussions. I hope if you're nearby you can make it too!</p>GEOPRESS_LOCATION(Denver, Colorado)</p>
