<p>The fact that I'm writing this "year in review" is indicative of the kind of year it's been. At the end of 2006, I thought that it was a crazy year - getting married, writing a book, winning the MapQuest contest -  and life would finally settle down a little bit. I was wrong. 2007 was an exciting, amazing, and incredibly busy year. </p>
<p>So here is a quick post-mortem on the major events of 2007:</p>

<p>There was a smattering of other events, the most important being Corrie finishing her dissertation! I'm very excited what 2008 will bring, already looking like Africa and Vietnam are on the itinerary at some point and several conferences. Of course, knowing where I'll be living after January will be a definite plus. </p>
<p>Thanks for a great year 2007!</p>
