  content: "Hey, nice running into you again, at BarCamp -- I looked for you on Facebook,
    to add you, but didn't find a profile. Are you not on there?\r\n\r\nAlso, are
    you guys gonna do something for Apps for Democracy? I don't think I'm gonna hack
    for this contest, but I definitely want to check out the winning mashups."

  content: Also, have you guys thought about doing a DCRUG presentation on Ruby an
    mapping technologies? Would be an interesting change of pace.

<p>The very first session I attended was moderated by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pcorbett">Peter Corbett</a> from iStrategyLabs and <a href="http://kachaev.com/" title="kachaev.com">Dmitry Kachaev</a> of the <a href="http://www.octo.dc.gov/" title="Office of the Chief Technology Officer">Office of the CTO for DC</a> talking about open data from the government.</p>
<p>The Princeton research paper <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1138083" title="SSRN-Government Data and the Invisible Hand by David Robinson, Harlan Yu, William Zeller, Edward Felten">"Government Data and the Invisible Hand"</a> proclaims the need for government agencies to first and foremost share their data via open and broadly used standards (via <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080603-study-gov-websites-should-focus-on-rss-xmlnot-redesigns.html" title="Study: .gov web sites should focus on RSS, XML'&rdquo;not redesigns">Ars Technica</a>).</p>
<p>The DC government is already sharing a large amount of data via a variety for formats: <a href="http://georss.org/" title="GeoRSS | GeoRSS :: Geographically Encoded Objects for RSS feeds">GeoRSS</a>, KML, CSV, Shapefiles. Check it out at <a href="http://data.octo.dc.gov" title="Data Catalog">http://data.octo.dc.gov</a> and also <a href="http://capstat.oca.dc.gov/" title="CapStat: Building a City That Works">CapStat: Building a City That Works</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Information. Knowledge. Progress. Welcome to CapStat, your resource as a District of Columbia resident to track how District Government is working for you. You can use these pages to track the performance of individual agencies, find neighborhood statistics and learn how your government is responding to the city's most pressing challenges. As the District of Columbia works to become a world-class city, visit this page to follow its progress and find out how you can become part of the solution.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>When the <a href="http://www.octo.dc.gov" title="Office of the Chief Technology Officer">Office of the CTO for DC</a> wanted to update their site and services they brainstormed how to do this - the typical method of hiring a very expensive contractor to build a complicated tool that would be poorly implemented - or open up the system for the community and see what emerges.</p>
<p>Fortunately they chose the latter and recently launched <a href="http://appsfordemocracy.org" title="Apps for Democracy - An Innovation Challenge by iStrategyLabs for the DC Government and Beyond">Apps for Democracy</a> - a contest that anyone can submit an entry for a mashup or application using the DC data services.</p>
<h3>Data stream of data</h3></p>
<p>One comment that came up was the desire for a feed of the available data and updates. Right now there is a web page and some of the data is available as GeoRSS - so continually updated. However, what would really be great and facilitate federation would be a published GeoRSS feed of datasets that links to each of the available formats, updated times, filesizes, metadata, etc.</p>GEOPRESS_LOCATION(Washington, DC)</p>
