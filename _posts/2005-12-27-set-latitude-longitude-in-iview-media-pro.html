    a check to see if exiftool exists and a note if it doesn't (if one just copied
    the script to another computer or whatever or they forgot to read the directions)."

  content: "Hi Andrew.\r\n Great script. I bumped into it because I've been stuck
    trying to manipulate exif data in iView using applescript alone. It's easy to
    script the manipulation of annotations data, but it seems really tricky to do
    so with exif data (within iView). I ran into one script that manipulates the capture
    date without a seperate tool like exiftool (http://downloads.iview-multimedia.com//scripts/ShiftCaptureDate.sit)
    but I've been unable to get it to work with altitude, which is the exif info I
    am seeking to set/edit/add.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I took your script and modified
    it to 1) read existing GPS coordinates and then fetch via the geonames web service
    the cooresponding altitude (via a clumsy safari gui scripting hack). I also modified
    the script so that it would process all selected items in the open iView catalog.
    I'm just learning applescript so I'd be interested in improvements. I'll post
    the script in another next response to this thread.\r\n\r\nDane"

<p>I'm making the transition to a much more stable, usable, and tool-rich photo management tool, <a href="">iView Media Pro 3</a>. I got tired of dealing with the <strong>incredibly</strong> slow interface to iPhoto thanks to Apple's incapable handling & testing of EXIF metadata in storing to their library.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<h3>Behold, there was scripting</h3><br />
... and it was good.</p>
<p>I had written an Applescript to <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/289/">set the latitude & longitude</a> (and other location info) to selected photos in iPhoto. iPhoto was often beligerent and required a restart of the iPhoto (and possible database recreation) to read the location information (which was viewable in the "info" panel).</p>
<p>iView puts the location info as a user-editable set of fields in the EXIF data fields. Users can set city, region, country, etc. But for whatever reason, they are unable to change the latitude & longitude.</p>
<p>I paired down my iPhoto script to just handle latitude & longitude and handle getting the file name from iView. The tough part was how to get from the iView example <em>selected_images</em> to a useful POSIX path to feed to <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a>. This code does the trick.</p>
<pre><code><br />
set selectedID to selected_images(1)<br />
if selectedID = {} then<br />
	display dialog "No photos selected"<br />
	return<br />
end if</p>
<p>repeat with this_photo in selectedID<br />
	set photo_path to path of this_photo<br />
	set the image_file to the POSIX path of photo_path<br />
</code></pre></p>
<h3>Installing & Using the script</h3><br />
<a href="http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/iViewLocation_latitude.jpg"><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-iViewLocation_latitude.jpg' alt='iView Location Plugin - User Entry' align="right" hspace="10px"/></a><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/projects/applescript/SetLatLon.zip">Download the script here</a> and expand it in your <em>~/Library/Application Support/iView/Plug-ins/Scripts</em> folder and then reload iView.  You will also need <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">exiftool</a>, as it is the real magic behind the smoke & mirrors.</p>
<p>To use the script, select whatever photos you want to apply the <em>same</em> location information to. Then go to the "Scripts" icon in the menu bar, and choose the "Set Lat/Lon" script. Enter the latitude, longitude, and altitude in decimal format, pressing "OK" after each field. Wait a little while, and then a dialog will tell you how many photos were processed.</p>
<p><a href='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/iViewLocation_post_export.jpg' ><img src='http://highearthorbit.com/wp-images/thumb-iViewLocation_post_export.jpg' alt='iView Location Plugin - Post Export' align="right" hspace="10px"/></a>Back in iView, you should see the latitude & longitude information in the right side-bar. You can also turn on lat/lon view in the thumbnail view by pressing <em>Command-J</em> and selecting "Latitude" "Longitude" "Altitude". You may need to press <em>Command-B</em> to rebuild the thumbnail to have the info show up the first time (or on updates). </p>
<p>When exporting images (say to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr!</a>), your geo-annotated data will stay intact and can then be <a href="http://geobloggers.com">mapped</a> (or <a href='http://www.flickrmap.com/'>mapped</a>).</p>
