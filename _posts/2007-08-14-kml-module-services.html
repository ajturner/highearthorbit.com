<p>As I mentioned previously - I'm continuing the <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/ogc-agile-geography-kick-off-discussion-of-kml-3/" title="High Earth Orbit &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; OGC Agile Geography Kick-off Discussion of KML 3">KML 3</a> discussion and blog posts to the Mapufacture blog starting with <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com/2007/08/14/kml-modules-services/" title="mapufacture blog &raquo; KML Modules: Services">KML Module: Services</a>. Very soon Mapufacture will start implementing some of the proposed changes as a testbed for trying out the new KML formats and capabilities. When it's available, I'll blog about how to start playing with it.</p>
<p>So if you want to continue playing along, track on over to the <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com/" title="mapufacture blog">Mapufacture blog</a>, or just toss the <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com/feed/" title="mapufacture blog RSS" type="application/rss+xml">RSS</a> or <a href="http://blog.mapufacture.com/atom/" title="mapufacture blog" type="application/atom+xml">Atom</a> feed into your reader and you'll probably not notice the difference.</p>
