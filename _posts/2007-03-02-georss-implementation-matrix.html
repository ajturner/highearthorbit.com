<p>The GeoRSS community has had a rapid-fire discussion on formats, standards, future and current status of some of the features in GeoRSS. One of the major points that has come out is the importance of reference implementations, or common libraries other developers can drop into their projects to add GeoRSS support in all its multitude of flavors. </p>
<p>To this end, I started up a <a href="http://georss.org/trac/trac.cgi/wiki/ImplementationMatrix" title="GeoRSS Implementation Matrix">GeoRSS Implementation Matrix</a>. Please let me know what other libraries exist for consuming or publishing (I probably need to add that distinction to the matrix) GeoRSS and what formats it supports. </p>
<p>Hopefully we should soon be able to point developers at libraries they can use, or at least reference, for using GeoRSS and at a higher level we could point users and devs to existing modules (such as for blog and CMS engines) that they can use in their apps. </p>
