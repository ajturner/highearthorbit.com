<p><a href="http://brainoff.com">Mikel</a>, <a href="http://www.asklater.com/steve/" title="SteveC">Steve Coast</a>, and I gave our 3-hour workshop yesterday talking through our work and thoughts on hacking geo sites and open data. I think it went well overall - and welcome feedback from anyone that attended.</p>
<p>Then last night I gave an Ignite talk on the work we're doing at Mapufacture to provide customized GeoWeb services. It was less of a "production pitch" than other presentations - something that I'll talk about in another post about the changing face of the Where2.0 conference. The video</p>
<p>This morning Adrian talked about what <a href="http://www.everyblock.com/" title="EveryBlock &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; A news feed for your block">EveryBlock</a> is doing to explore the next generation of Where2.0 apps that are bringing better cartography and localized news to the web.  </p>
<p>I'll try and cover more news and talks that are interesting as they happen.</p>
