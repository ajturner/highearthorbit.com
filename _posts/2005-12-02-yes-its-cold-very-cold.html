<p>Over the past 2 years, I've learned Michigan's weather is as forth-right and direct as its inhabitants. Seasons last very long, and then <strong>snap</strong> you wake up one morning and it's 20 degrees colder/warmer outside. </p>
<p><em>Welcome to Winter</em>. I think I was wearing shorts 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Last night, whilst scraping various, alternating, layers of ice and snow off my car, a large bundle of wool and fabric trundled past me with 2 large dogs. A female voice echoed forth:</p>
<p>    Her:  "That doesn't look like much fun."</p>
<p>    Me: "It's just the beginning now, isn't it?"</p>
<p><em>slight pause</em></p>
<p>    Her: "Thanks for cheering me up."</p>
