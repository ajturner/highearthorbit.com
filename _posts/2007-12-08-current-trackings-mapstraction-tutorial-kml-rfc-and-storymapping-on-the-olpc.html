  content: "Dear Andrew,\r\n\r\nFirst let me tell you that I think you are terrific.
    We both know that few people really understand what you are doing but I know it
    will help my mission to establish Peace on Earth by 2027. Part of what I am doing
    involves universal education.\r\nI googled OLPC and Arlington and one of the choices
    landed me here. You will find, if you decide to work with me, that I have a very
    open mind. If you can tell me your idea I can probably break it down to the LCD
    and tell you where to start.\r\nThe remainder of people who need to be educated
    at least to read, write, and do basic math fall into 3 groups. Poor, remote, disabled
    and/or otherwise challenged making them a poor candidate for traditional classrooms.\r\nI
    need to set up a Beta program, I would like it to be run through Arlington Public
    School, to be able to film actual children and their progress with the online
    educational process. Adding the mapping element you are working on will give the
    children of the world a better feel of where their new age pen pals live at."

<p>I'm a little behind on some news, so here's a quick run down of interesting things from this week:</p>
<dl>
<dt>24ways to impress your friends</dt></p>
<dd>I wrote a very quick <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/get-to-grips-with-slippy-maps" title="24 ways: Get To Grips with Slippy Maps">introduction tutorial on adding maps to your web site using Mapstraction</a> as part of the <a href="http://24ways.org/" title="24 ways">24ways</a> advent calendar.</dd></p>
<dt>KML 2.2 Request for Public Comment</dt></p>
<dd>The OGC recently announced a <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/802" title="The OGC Seeks Comment on OGC Candidate KML 2.2 Standard | OGC&Acirc;&reg;">request for public comment of the first "OGC" version of KML</a>, essentially a stamped 2.2 that is the currently documented <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kml_tags_beta1.html" title="KML 2.2 Reference (Beta) - KML - Google Code">Google version</a>. The standard is <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/45" title="Request for Comment on KML 2.2 | OGC&Acirc;&reg;">available at the OGC site. This comment period runs from December 4 until January 3 - conveniently timed over the popularly vacant winter holidays, but that means nice fire-side reading.</a></dd></p>
<dt>Global Child Stories with the OLPC</dt></p>
<dd>Reading over the large catalog of applications available an in development for the OLPC, I ran across the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Our_Stories" title="Our Stories - OLPC">"Our Stories"</a> application, developed jointly with UNICEF nad Google support, to provide a platform and site for children to annotate their communities and lives. The companion site, <a href="http://www.ourstories.org/" title="Our Stories">OurStories.org</a> is a simple, but intriguing map of the stories from around the world. Makes me really think I need to get an OLPC to work on projects like this to help enable story telling and community building. Oddly the projec is using a unique <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OurStoriesXML" title="OurStoriesXML - OLPC">OurStoriesXML</a> rather than something like Atom which supports all of the desired functionality (title, description, photos, location, audio, author). I've suggested this on the wiki discussion.</dd><br />

<p>I'm setting up a special "travelog" installation of GeoPress that I'll be using while traveling through China and will drop a link here when it's ready.</p>
