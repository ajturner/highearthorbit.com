<p>I rececently found out about <a href="http://www.bleepsoft.com/buildfactory/" title="BuildFactory homepage">BuildFactory</a>. It provides tools like: continuous integration (ala Rails testing), building out of Subversion, and building multiple projects.</p>
<p>Another feature I'd really like to see in some grander build-tool is being able to link Cocoa projects to online bug tracking, like <a href='http://www.edgewall.com/trac/' title='Trac homepage'>Trac</a>, to link to the appropriate files/lines and changes.</p>
