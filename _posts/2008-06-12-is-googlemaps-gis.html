  content: "If you go by the true defination of GIS, more often than not you get an
    answer that would include GoogleMaps.  Example:\r\n\r\nFrom American Heritage
    Dictionary\r\nGIS (Abbr): Geographic Information System   \r\nA computer application
    used to store, view, and analyze geographical information, especially maps. \r\n--In
    this case, Google Maps is a GIS.  \r\nGoogle is \r\n  1. A Computer application
    (anyone doubt this)\r\n  2. Used to store (all roads in US), view (webpage map),
    and analyze (get directions) geographical information.\r\n  3. especially maps
    (ie google MAPS).\r\n\r\nSo with this I would have to say that Google Maps is
    a GIS.  It is not the only GIS but it is still a GIS.  Try entering \"define:GIS\"
    in google search bar.  You get back about 20 definitions of GIS, almost all fitting
    with the above example.\r\n\r\nFrom your light switch example, I would say that
    you are using GIS as defined as Geospatial Information Sciences (more commonly
    abbr as GISc).  If you are indeed talking about GISc, then I would agree with
    you that Google Maps is not a GIS (or GISc).  Too often I thing people interchange
    Geographic Information Systems with Geographic Information Sciences."

  content: "To me, \"Google Maps\" is the quickest and easiest way that I can describe
    to a non-geo-person what a GIS is. I always make sure to emphasize the word \"system\"
    however, noting that's it's not only the GUI or end user application, but also
    the servers, databases, algorithms, etc. that make up the GIS. So yes, when viewed
    as such, Google Maps is a GIS.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I just started studying GIS
    6 months ago. :)"

    Andrew.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, I don't feel that I am challenging you, per se.
    \ Rather, your post on the Green Buildings mashup included a sentiment ('off-hand
    comment') that caught my attention, and subequently led me to simply throw out
    the question of whether \"Google Maps is GIS\" to a broader audience.\r\n\r\nOkay,
    enough of me...let's hear from some other folks."

  content: "I'd have to agree that Google Maps|Earth is not a GIS, in that it does
    not offer analysis services.  That it offers directions (an application of available
    data using an algorithm unrelated to the core Google imagery and questionably
    related to the map data in hand does not constitute analysis.  Sorry.\r\n\r\nGoogle's
    applications are, however, depiction services of some import.  I think these are
    a stellar example of what out-of-the-box good coders can come up with to advance
    a field (whether they're GIS or not, they're improving both the practice of GISci
    and GIS).\r\n\r\nI will also agree that electronic mapping tools in general, and
    geospatial information tools more specifically, are becoming ubiquitous.  I will
    step out on a limb and suggest that in the foreseeable future, say, within 10
    years, there will be sufficient dissemination of GIS tools and techniques so that
    we no longer consider \"normal\" GIS a technical specialty, but instead, we'll
    consider training the geomaticists and GIScientists who will drive new technique
    development, rather than training the GIS practitioners."

  content: Yes Google Maps/Earth is a GIS, under any definition you want to use.
    It is a geographic information service. I dont think that there can be any argument
    there. Is it science?  It all depends on how you use it. At its base, it allows
    the user to view information, aerial or satellite images, and learn something
    about the area they are looking at. I dont think that you can look at the work
    a number of scientists have done with the images in discovering ruins or meteor
    craters that have been long undiscovered and would have remained so without Google
    Maps. That is science. It may not be the analytical tools that an ArcGIS might
    give, but it is a tool. Arc does things that Google maps will never do, and Google
    maps does things that Arc will never do. So for me it is solidly in the spectrum
    of GIS tools that are available.

  content: "From my point of view Google Maps/Google Earth has been put into a
    corner that it was never meant to be in. As far as I can see it was never meant
    to be a full blown GIS. \r\n\r\nPeople have rightfully pointed out that the analysis
    capabilities of Google Maps/Google Earth are rather limited. However, it has
    to some degree revolutionized the way we deal with geospatial data with respect
    to visualization. It does a marvelous job of making the data accessible to a broader
    public. The analysis is limited to basic functionality of a GIS: measuring distances
    and navigational features. Nothing wrong with that. However, it does not offer
    anything beyond that. If you are looking for something that does some complex
    three-dimensional geospatial analysis, you will not find it in Google Maps/Google
    Earth.\r\n\r\nKevin cited a perfectly valid definition of GIS. One of the issue
    that Google Maps/Google Earth does not really address is maps. And I am talking
    here about full support of map projections (and datums). The default cylindrical
    projection that is behind Google Earth works fine for basic visualization purposes
    for the entire globe. Try the current Google Maps API for regions close to the
    poles. It just falls apart because it was never meant to be used in this way.
    I don't think GIS was in anybody's mind when Google Earth was conceptualized in
    the first place. The proper use of map projections with the accuracy that you
    would expect from your GIS analysis completely contradicts the use on a global
    scale.\r\n\r\nAs David rightfully pointed out, an ArcGIS does things that Google
    Earth/Google Maps will probably never will be able to do. And vice versa.
    I am working in the field of remote sensing. Do I use Google Earth for visualizing
    scientific data? Whenever it is appropriate, e.g. showing people where a certain
    data set is located. Google Earth comes with its own reference system of global
    satellite image coverage. Can't beat that with anything else but virtual globes."

  content: "There's a lot of discussion about semantics, what's 'GIS' and what even
    goes beyond GIS - with some people viewing GIS just as traditional desktop GIS
    - with others dodging the GIS term and looking at the breadth of activities, from
    locational technologies to NSDI and metadata catalogs, and so on...\r\n\r\nThere's
    also the flurry of people who've latched on to mapping APIs and have produced
    a few maps, to now pronounce themselves the gurus of GIS - Great to see their
    enthusiasm, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.  And often, they don't even
    want to be bothered with little things like geodesy, projection systems and why
    their data doesn't line up properly.....\r\n\r\nFurther, where does all the other
    depth and breadth of analysis - real, interactive analysis, using geoprocessing
    and models fit, how about non-geographic visualization of locational data, such
    as schematics, and so on?\r\n\r\nGoogle Maps and Google Earth are just the tip
    of the iceberg...  But it's good that folks are seeing the value and power that
    it can bring."

  content: "I would argue that GIS is too broad of a term.\r\n\r\nStating that Photoshop
    and Paint are both graphic arts programs is a true statement.  So are Final Cut
    Pro, Flash, and Illustrator.  But anyone knows comparing them makes Paint look
    lackluster next to a full-featured professional piece of software.  Its &acirc;&euro;&oelig;analysis&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t include advanced algorithms in filters or alpha channels,
    but when you need a quick screen capture, cropped with a little red arrow, it
    performs every time.  Compare to http://www.picnik.com/ for a true
    online/offline comparison.\r\n\r\nI think it is a similar situation with GMaps|Earth
    and Arc.  With overlays like MyMaps, KML, and geoRSS, the basics are there to
    add and manipulate data.  Can a citizen query a hosted parcel layer with 470,000
    records for the property at his current location using GPS and GMaps on his phone,
    then pull in wetland data from the county, floodplain from FEMA, and zoning from
    the city, all while in the field?  Not yet.  Could we get to that point?  Absolutely.
    \ Should we?  That is what we are trying to figure out&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;"

  content: Good post, Andrew. The NeoGeo vs GIS debate is fascinating and I think
    its going to be a while before it is resolved. I also think blanket statements
    such as "GIS is dead" or "Google ain't GIS" completely miss the central point
    that we now have a much richer toolset than we did just a few short years ago.
    There will always be a place for heavy-duty analytical packages, but the new,
    lightweight tools are satisfying a widespread journalistic-type usage that GIS
    could never do. It's time to acknowledge that both GIS and neo-geo drive each
    other and most importantly, get people actively engaged and thinking about place,
    space, and location.

  content: "Another way to look at it might be:  are ArcExplorer, Tatuk Viewer, etc..
    GISystems?  I usually refer to them as viewers, so there are many levels of functionality
    in a GISystem (ArcView doesn't have the same functionality as ArcInfo).  Google
    Maps and Google Earth, if they are GIS, then I would consider them to be on par
    with a viewer.  Just like I wouldn't use ArcExplorer to create a geodatabase,
    edit topology errors, and query the data, I'm not going to use Google Maps for
    these purposes.  I can use viewers to share information, and in some cases Google
    Maps is much better for this than a static map (I mean who doesn't have internet
    access these days).  We use the term scale (or global v local) all the time, why
    not use the same sort of ontology with GISystems.\r\n\r\nI prefer not to knock
    Google Maps as a GIS, because I think Maps and Earth have done a lot to improve
    peoples' knowledge and interest in Geography in the last few years."

  content: "Great set of thoughts and reactions. \r\n\r\nOne thing I should clarify
    about my point of view. I wasn't question all of \"GoogleMaps\", but more of the
    \"static features on a slippy map\" - Google MyMaps and other placemarking applications.
    \r\n\r\nThe reason for me asking this question isn't meant as a negative view
    of Google's, Microsoft's, Multimap's, etc. toolsets and features. It's more about
    the management of expectations and the claims that a static map with markers on
    it is a \"GIS\".\r\n\r\nGoing back to the original site, it had stated that they
    were providing an advanced \"GIS\" of Green Buildings. So it was the question
    of the claim of an advanced tool for investigation and visualization versus markers
    on a map. \r\n\r\nAnd the discussion of \"What is GIS\" is valuable as it gives
    everyone the chance to reflect and discuss the broader goals we're all working
    towards. Those of you on the Geowanking mailing list may be following the critical
    conversation of \"just another mash-up\" that I also think is a good question
    to be asking and addressing. Especially as Dave Smith points out that there is
    an influx, or at least cross-over of geospatial amateurs with experts."

  content: "I am of the opinion that the \"G\" in GIS is detrimental to the way we
    look at spatial data.  Why restrict this field, that could easily be called Spatial
    Information Systems, to geography?  Think of how many \"indoor\" applications
    people have built...  Is that geography?  What about mapping of the human body?
    \ That's still spatial, right?  There are a multitude of other examples that come
    to mind...\r\n\r\nThis argument is semantic.  I am a spatial information specialist.
    \ I try to convey information about locations/space as good as possible.  Depending
    on the resources I have at my disposal, I look at different options for disseminating
    spatial information to a client/society/domain expert.  \r\n\r\nGoogle
    Earth is free.  Virtual Earth is free.  ESRI is not, by any measure.  Well, OK,
    do I really need a crazy projection or exact double precision measurements with
    a 256 Tb capacity for my spiffy file geodatabase?  Yes?  OK lets go with ESRI
    and accept the cost.  No?  OK let do it open source because it's free (and a lot
    more fun).  \r\n\r\nWith that said, I didn't really get at whether or not Google
    Earth is a GIS, just that, \"does it matter?\""

  content: "I find it helpful to look at it like this:\r\nThere are three categories
    of GIS users, distinguished by their primary use case and what they need to do
    what they do.\r\n\r\nCategory 1 are the data creators/maintainers.  They compile
    geographic information from other sources (legal/historical documents, remote
    \ sensing, etc.). They also add value to the data by relating it to other data,
    find and correct errors, and normalize/denormalize the data into models that
    are appropriate for special purposes (e.g. geocoding or graphic rendering).  Category
    1 users are generally highly trained professionals who have specific domain knowledge
    and use expensive hardware and software. They may also engage in application development
    to standardize and optimize their activities.\r\n\r\nCategory 2 users are analysts.
    \ They consume and add value to the data from the Category 1 users. They perform
    mathmatical or statistical analysis that answers specific research or business
    questions that are too unique to be scripted in advance. They must be able to
    interpret the question in domain specific terms (\"We need to find a location
    for the new branch office so we cost-effectively get maximum exposure to our target
    market\" or \"Where are the convenience-store robbers likely to strike next\")
    and translate the question into a specific series of operations on geospatial
    and other data, and then phrase the results in terms that domain experts can understand.
    Like Category 1, are generally highly trained professionals who have specific
    domain knowledge and use expensive hardware and software, and  may also engage
    in application development to standardize and optimize their activities.\r\nCategories
    1 and 2 comprise the traditional, old-school GIS roles. Historically, GIS professionals
    have moved back and forth between these roles, until they end up in a career niche
    of one kind or another. Those roles won't ever go away, but their growth is fairly
    limited.\r\n\r\nCategory 3, on the other hand, is anybody with a browser. Their
    use cases start with the words \"I just wanna...\" (e.g. \"...see a map\" or \"...get
    directions to this address\").  The don't know or care about coordinate systems,
    data models, normalization, versioned geodatabases, file formats, or any of the
    other issues that Category 1 and 2 users struggle with all the time. They just
    want a simple answer to (what seems to them) a simple question. Old-school professionals
    may look down their noses at them, call them amateurs or idiots. They may get
    territorial about the invasion and the dumbing-down of their GIS domain. But this
    is the scalable market on a hockey-stick growth curve. Tiny productivity gains
    have huge net impacts when they're shared by such a wide audience.\r\n\r\nWhom
    do you want to develop applications for?"

  content: "Since people are still talking about this I thought I'd add my two cents.\r\n\r\nI've
    worked for over a decade with GIS and have done extensive research into different
    applications of GIS.  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I am not too sure but I would lean towards
    calling Google Maps a GIS application, whereas the entire system with server,
    etc. is the GIS.  \r\n\r\nFor example, how many people here have developed with
    ArcView and/or ArcIMS/ArcGIS Server or Map Server?  Would you consider
    those GISes?  What would you call the applications you develop on them?  \r\n\r\nWould
    ArcExplorer alone be a GIS or would the entire system?  If I can develop on an
    ArcServer backend can't I do similar functionalities with a Google Map Server
    backend?  The answer is yes, I have personally added features to a Google map
    application to query and retrieve data.\r\n\r\nAs an example consider this - a
    client I know wanted a custom GIS application done that could remotely query an
    ArcServer to get the location of certain assets upon request.\r\n\r\nThis system
    did not provide buffering, etc. - although through the backend the server did,
    as I assume Google Maps Server through custom querying may.  I considered this
    a GIS application that is part of a GIS.  However, I could be wrong and that is
    why I wanted to share this to see how others would respond.\r\n\r\nMany of us
    who have worked extensively with ESRI and other vendors generally have a problem
    with calling anything that does not seem exactly like the desktop interface we've
    grown to love called a GIS.  However, when you examine the generic definition,
    even CAD systems that work with spatial geographic databases can be considered
    GIS."

  content: "The issue is the evolution of technology. Geographical Information System
    may be viewed alongside technologies like Cinematoraphy , Photography, Photogrametry
    for illustration, technologies that have been forced to evolve based on indisputable
    modern realities.\r\n\r\nWith the evolution of  cloud computing, grid computing,
    virtualisation and virtual reality, the concepts of information processing, analysis
    and visualisation are taking new perspectives, leaving behind traditional norms,
    like GIS.\r\n\r\nGoogle earth, Microsoft virtual earth, QGIS and other s are more
    relevant for land related information systems today than traditional directions."

<p>In my <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/i-like-freeing-data-green-buildings-in-california">previous post about building a KML of the California green building directory</a> I made a very off-hand comment about how a GoogleMap does not mean GIS. <a href="http://www.blinkgeo.com/2008/06/is-google-maps-gis/" title="BlinkGeo &Acirc;&raquo; Is Google Maps GIS?">Andres has challenged</a> my comment and provoked a very thoughtful discussion.</p>
<p>My original comment was merely based on the original article of the Green Building site that seemed to imply that GoogleMaps alone meant a GIS. My feelings are that mapping tools have become ubiquitous and easy to use - not requiring advanced expertise to utilize for visualizing geospatial information.</p>
<p>This thought more generally goes along with previous discussions about <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/neogeography-towards-a-definition/" title="Neogeography - towards a definition :: High Earth Orbit">what is Neogeography</a>, though more focused on the underlying technologies and even the question if GIS is primarily a set of technologies or is it the techniques, and application of those techniques?</p><br />

<p>From my perspective, the claim that a web map is GIS is similar to saying that a light switch is Electrical Engineering. Engineering was used in the design and development of the house electrical system and grid. But in the end, the light switch has become a commodity. It's a device anyone can grab off of a local hardware store shelf and install in their house.</p>
<p>The digital incarnation of geospatial tools has quickly changed the landscape of GIS and geo-applications. GoogleMaps and associated slippy maps, geocoders, and visualization tools are an impressive integration of techniques and technologies, but it has also become a commodity that any developer can quickly implement into a site. This does not detract from their usefulness, but merely is a comment on the reduced knowledge and expertise an implementer or user requires to make preliminary use of such a system.</p>
<p>What does this mean for GIS? <a href="http://fantom-planet.blogspot.com/" title="FANTOM PLANET">FantomPlanet</a> pointed out the <a href="http://twitter.com/fantomplanet/statuses/830135562" title="Twitter / fantomplanet: What would excite the geo c...">same thought</a>. GIS has the capability to lead the way in developing more advanced tools. GoogleMaps has made the idea of web mapping vernacular, and that means there is a strong desire for better tools to reach into more places. More advanced techniques and understanding will push these new tools to provide analysis and understanding of complex processes.</p>
<p>Thanks for challenging me Andres! Join the discussion.</p>
