  content: "Is it the case that each character is spoken as one syllable?  I've noticed
    when reading credits on Chinese movies that when an English translation is provided
    that there's a charactersyllable mapping.  In fact, you can often find the same
    syllable in a few names and deduce which character matches it.\r\n\r\nAnd since
    I understand characters to be words, that means that one word maps to one syllable
    as well, presumably with the tonal aspect.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, would it
    then follow that there are about 900 syllables used to cover 90% of an evening
    newscast?  Or is spoken Chinese richer than written Chinese?\r\n\r\nAnd to go
    off on a tangent, is there some aspect of a written character that immediately
    tells you which category of word it is -- noun, verb, adjective, etc?\r\n\r\nAre
    the characters for verbs somehow \"conjugated\" to indicate whether it is I, you,
    we, he, etc. who is the actor?  Or is it done with a separate character?"

<p>Reuters has an article that <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060523/sc_nm/china_language_dc_1'>fewer characters being used in written Chinese</a> than 'before' (not sure when before was). For example, you typically need to know 900 characters to read 90% of current publications. People usually gawk at the number of characters they say that Chinese writers/readers must learn, of the 50,000 individual characters that exist.</p>
<p>However, as Slate points out, there are currently <a href='http://www.slate.com/id/2139611/'>almost 1,000,000 (million) English words</a>, 50,000 of which are headwords - or the primary, bold-faced, word.  I also had a statistic around somewhere about how many English words make up 90% of a typical daily newspaper, but cannot find it (silly data...)</p>
<p>And Chinese characters are commonly built up of radicals which indicate what the word can mean or deals with. Being an engineer, chinese script feels very "algebraic" to me. I learn what <em>x</em> and 2^y and &Iuml;&euro; mean. However, when you see "angry" and "hungry" do they give you any idea what they mean?</p>
<p>Other interesting <a href='http://www.languagemonitor.com/wst_page7.html'>facts</a>: there are fewer than 100,000 words in French, and 24,000 different words in the complete works of Shakespeare (1,700 were invented by him).  About 80% of the information stored in the world's computers (such as this text) are also in English. And as Joi Ito quandries: <a href='http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/12/15/if_news_is_not_in_english_did_it_happen.html'>If news is not in English, did it happen?"</a></p>
