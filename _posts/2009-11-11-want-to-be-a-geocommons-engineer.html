<p>It's time for the FortiusOne GeoCommons team to expand again - and we're looking for an incredibly bright, hard working, and team oriented engineer to head up our operations team.</p>
<p>GeoCommons is unique among most web applications - it isn't just deployed to the public web, but also to intranets, the cloud, and to the field. We have servers running in Jalabad, Afghanistan and Nairobi, Kenya, we help develop technology solutions within the Federal government and Intel, and work with Academia, disaster response, and major corporations.</p>

<p>Are you an engineer who likes playing with new technology and solving hard problems? Do you love writing Linux scripts that can deal with massively horizontally scaled servers or compressing systems to run on USB sticks? Do you have a passion for open data, open-source software, collaborative government, and cutting-edge technologies that help the world? An interest in mapping is obviously a plus.</p>
<p>Ping us through the blog, twitter, LinkedIn, email, or stop by our offices in Arlington VA to chat directly. And no, we don't need any recruiters.</p>
