<p><a href='http://www.feedmap.net/BlogMap/'>FeedMap</a> is another new kid on the block for blog geolocation mapping. This is very similar to <a href='http://geourl.com'>GeoURL</a> and its ilk. You'll notice the (slighty garish) blog map to the right. I'm looking for a way to better integrate it into the 'flow' (read: layout) of the site.</p>
