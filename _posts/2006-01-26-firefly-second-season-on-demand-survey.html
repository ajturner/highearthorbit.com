  content: "I've been looking at all different sites about this supposed season 2
    of Firefly. The thing that strikes me is people have been talking about it constantly
    since at least January. I'm not sure why it was taken off in the 1st place. It
    was very well done and could've unseated X-Files as my favorite show ever. I hope
    they bring it back. \r\nI signed the survey!\r\n\r\nP.S. Zak I'm with you bring
    back Wash.\r\nP.P.S - He played the pirate in Dodge Ball! :O)"

  content: "I hope they treat the movie as though it was a what if and never happened.
    \ Kind of like what they did for \"Ghost in the Shell\" TV series.  They treated
    the First movie and original story as though it never happened to bring back the
    star,  Which worked great in my opinion.  \r\n\r\nOdd as it sounds, because the
    movie was great, I say put it on the shelf as a hallucination never refer to it
    nothing act like it never happened make season two the way it was originally intended."

  content: "Firefly was the best show ever, would be awesome if they could bring it
    back. As much as i loved Wash &amp; Sheppard. I think they shouldn't bring them
    back, its like a growing point for the new series. It would be a misstake to undo
    serenity. People all around the world have been protesting to bring back firefly,
    so sad its now 2010 with no results. Movie companies bring out more and more crap
    every season, why do they can those shows with true potential. \r\n\r\nRita, it
    too is my air. I'm slowly suffocating in this lonely world without firefly...."

    networking sites.  'Cause I know I LOVE Firefly and that a lot of other people
    do as well.  If there was a way to organize everyone together and give what we
    need( an overwhelming response ) then maybe the network would pay attention.

    it to loves it and wonders why it went off air.\r\n\r\nI found out about it years
    after it was on television. I downloaded the episodes (I know, I know that's bad)
    and rented Serenity , then just this year purchased the DVD set. I know I am not
    alone.\r\nFanship will grow. It would be wise to continue making Firefly tv episodes
    and movies. GIVE ME MORE.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    also agree with making the series carry on from previous season, dont make the
    film introduced into the series, and it is seperate to it aswell, so if they do
    bring it back, heres praying, it wot have any thing to do with the movie.\r\nlove

    ever seen. it deserves to have at least two more seasons. then FOX, or whatever
    network can get the rights, will really start making money off of it.\r\nIf someone
    could get this to happen Firefly would NEVER be missing from TV again."

    When we came to episode 14, we actually thought there was something missing in
    the discs(we didn't look at the special features). \r\n\r\nTwo days later, I took
    the DVD back and was shocked to hear that this great show had been cancelled.
    Its really a shame that this series never got a fair chance. The DVD store guy
    sold me the serenity movie instead, and it was fantastic. One of the best action
    movies(and the best sci-fi movie) I've ever seen. \r\n\r\nNow I'm pissed. This
    show had become one of my favourites only to just end without any good reason."

  content: I just got a look at firefly on the science channel. I thought "this is
    a great new show". I was so excited that something better than stargate or that
    other garbage they put on tv was now happening. Imagine my surprise when I found
    out that this series was from 2003!!!!! I never even heard of it back then! I'm
    sooooooo sad that it was just a re-run and only out for one season! Why did is
    show not make it? It's FANTASTIC and hopefully it will find new fans like me with
    it's re broadcast. BRING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
