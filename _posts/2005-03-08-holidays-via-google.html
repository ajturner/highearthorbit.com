<p>Unbeknownst to me, and thankfully google corrected my mistake, today is <a href='http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womday97.htm'>International Women's Day</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
International Women's Day (8 March) is an occasion marked by women's groups around the world. This date is also commemorated at the United Nations and is designated in many countries as a national holiday. When women on all continents, often divided by national boundaries and by ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic and political differences, come together to celebrate their Day, they can look back to a tradition that represents at least nine decades of struggle for equality, justice, peace and development.<br />
