<p>Simon put up a link at LinuxJournal to his site <a href='http://hostip.info/'>hostip.info</a> that has done a really good job creating a hostip service (and some flashy, CIA-style graphics). He also mentions <a href='http://www.sarangworld.com/TRACEROUTE/patterns.php3'>SarangWorld</a> which I've checked out as well.</p>
<p>The API allows an easy way to bring this information into a number of other utilities:</p>
<p>http://hostip.info/api/rough.html?ip=192.168.0.1</p>
<p>Seems as though there are several people interested in compiling information on servers, ips and such. Now we just need to see about possibly coordinating our information. </p>
