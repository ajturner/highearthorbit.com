<p>Just in case you didn't know, 4 days ago from this very day, star HR6416 became aware of my existence as my space-time lightcone intercepted it. <a href='http://interconnected.org/home/more/lightcone/'>Lightcone</a> is a neat little site which produces an RSS feed of the stars that intersect your time-existence lightcone as they happen. (via <a href='http://feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/iBag?m=1221'>BoingBoing</a>)</p>
<p>And I'm already gettin' out my party hat for HR1614 which becomes aware of my birth in just 4 short weeks!</p>
