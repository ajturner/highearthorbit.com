<p>Taking up the charge put forth by Tom Steinberg of <a href='http://mysociety.org'>MySociety.org</a>, and his (more than likely) tongue-in-cheek suggestion that someone take the code underlying <a href='http://placeopedia.com'>Placeopedia</a> (assign geographic locations to <a href='http://wikipedia.org'>Wikipedia articles) and <a href='http://yourhistoryhere.com'>YourHistoryHere</a> (geographic locations of historical facts and interesting tidbits), I am pleased to announce:</p>
<p><a href='http://whereihadmyfirstkiss.com'><img src='http://www.whereihadmyfirstkiss.com/images/header.png' width='100%'></a><br />
<a href='http://whereihadmyfirstkiss.com'>WhereIHadMyFirstKiss</a>: Mapping the World's early romanace. </p>
<p>The project was a means by which to learn the structure of the MySociety framework. I've written up a brief HowTo <a href='http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/MappingSiteSetup?highlight=%28Setup%29'>setup a MySociety mapping site</a> in the wiki pages. You're on your own to create graphics (though I could share some tips).</p>
<p>I hope people will find WIHMFK (yay acronyms) a funny, and potentially interesting project in it's own right. Another small oddity produced by the web and people with too much energy/drive and not enough guidance. </p>
