<p>I'm heading up to New York City for the day to hobnob with Edward Norton as well as ThinkSocial, PepsiCo, TED, and others at <a href="http://thepromiseny.com/" title="The #Promise - June 10th, 2010 &acirc;&euro;&sup1; Home">The #Promise conference</a>, sharing our experience in corporate social responsibility and the potential impacts of using social media and technology in affecting global awareness and positive change.</p>
<p>I discussed our efforts more in depth on the <a href="http://blog.fortiusone.com/2010/06/10/corporate-social-responsibility-thepromisesocial-responsibility-and-public-good-are-ingrained-throughout-our-entire-company-and-solutions-we-are-passionate-about-open-data-information-sharing-a/" title="FortiusOne blog">FortiusOne blog</a> - especially about our entire culture of open sharing and collaboration in <a href="http://geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons</a> as well as supporting communities like <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/" title="Crisis Commons">CrisisCommons</a>.</p>
<p>Next week I will be in London and Swindon in the UK at the <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/cds/symposia/sskw10.html" title="The Third Spatial Sociocultural Knowledge Workshop">Socioculture knowledge workshop</a> discussing our work in a more academically rigorous venue.</p>
