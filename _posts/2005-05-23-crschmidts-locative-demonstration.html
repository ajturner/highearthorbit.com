<p><a href='http://crschmidt.net/symbian/locative/'>CRSchmidt</a> has done some excellent prototype work on locative apps using <a href='http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html'>Python for the Series 60</a> phones. What this does is allow someone with a Series 60 phone (e.g. <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/gadgets'>Nokia 6600</a>) and installed Python to enter their current location into their phone, which is then stored in a server database. You can see a simple effect to the right of this main website under "Current Location".</p>
<p>Beyond a neat hack, this would allow a person to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Track their current location, write blog entries, and later link up tracks, photos, etc.</li>
<li>Inform loved ones, friends, etc. as to your whereabouts for purposes of meeting up, and or stalking</li>
<li>Grab LBS (location based services) information about your current location. For example, when I mark that I'm in Wichita, Kansas I could then pull up a <a href='http://geobloggers.com'>GeoBloggers</a> listing of pictures and tours, a <a href='http://wikitravel.org'>WikiTravel</a> page, or perhaps a <a href='http://maps.google.com'>GoogleMap</a> (without required GPS unit). </li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>I've made some modifications to <a href='http://crschmidt.net/symbian/locative/'>CRSchmidt's</a> oroginal locate.py and locate.php scripts that allow a user to mark: "Name, City, Region, Country, Comments (like an entry), and even Tags (cafe, restaurant, museum, etc.). I will be uploading these shortly (still testing a little bit)</p>
