  content: "Tim - QGIS is cryptic to neogeographers who don't have any GIS background.
    I think QGIS is great for as much as I have figured out to do with it, but in
    the days of (1) launch app, (2) be productive in a few minutes without reading
    any manual the usability bar is set pretty high.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's not
    really QGIS, it's the users... and that means a whole lot of work for user interface
    designers everywhere.\r\n\r\nI think being able to drag &amp; drop a shapefile
    or other data source onto a running QGIS would go a long way towards de-cryptification. "

  content: "My bad - as Allan points out, this is more PEBKAC (Problem Exists Between
    Keyboard And Chair), but I'm a huge proponent of simple to use interfaces to get
    up and running. Perhaps that's why I use a Mac.\r\n\r\nLet me dig into QGIS more
    and get back with specific notes to you. "

Along the way he uses the powerful<strike>i,f somewhat cryptic,</strike> <a href="http://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> and the very difficult, but even more powerful WMS. </p>
<p>It's a great tutorial, an very short owing to the power and ease of use open tools have developed into. Open tools can now begin to accomplish real GIS work instead of being solely for the <a href="http://www.storymapping.org/" title="StoryMapping.org">StoryMapper</a> or <a href="http://platial.com" title="Platial">Neogeographer</a>. </p>
