<p>Of course, within minutes of walking in I started getting feature requests from reporters and bloggers. One of these was the ability to easy page through reports by state (hint: http://votereport.us/?count=200&amp;state=VA).</p>
<p>We did our best to get a quick web-based map visualization up that would be usable by a large number of people with basic browsers. This limited the number of markers to 200 (one reason <a href="http://geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons">we</a> chose to use Flash for our <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com" title="GeoCommons Maker!">current rendering tool</a>). However, one way of addressing this was to offer a KML file that works very well in GoogleEarth for large sets of markers. Here are the 10,000 reports as of this evening.</p>

<p>Another feature we snuck in recently are some simple statistics on the number and time of reports today at <a href="http://votereport.us/reports/stats" title="VoteReport usage statistics">http://votereport.us/reports/stats</a>:</p>
