<p>Its typical, you get a nice camera (or two), go on a couple of trips, and you've very quickly created gigabytes of photographs that you then need to sort through. Automator doesn't quite have the ability to bring in Riya for marking the people in your photos, or rating their quality, so you spend your Sunday afternoon just marking, annotating, rating, deleting, aligning, color-correcting, sharpening, etc.</p>
<p>I'm using iView Media Pro, and always wondered about the <em>Subject</em> and <em>Scene</em> options in the Metadata. <abbr title='iView Media Pro'>iVMP has <strong>the</strong> best metadata editing I've found in any </abbr><abbr title='Digital Asset Management'>DAM</abbr>. There just seem to be perhaps <em>too</em> many metadata options.</p>
<p>Turns out there is this whole <em>history</em> to photography. In fact, there are 28 groups of terms called <a href='http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newscodes/'>NewsCodes</a> that are used to help fully annotate media. These NewsCodes might specify that a media archive is of "cartoon", "criminal", "nightclub", or "derivative securities" and that the location was "underwater", "aerial", "rear view", or "offbeat". The <a href='http://www.iptc.org/NewsCodes/'>IPTC NewsCodes</a> offer a complete listing of the currently suggested vocabulary. And they're ever so thoughtful to offer a <em>Windows</em> program for viewing and saving the NewsML files.</p>
<p><abbr title='iView Media Pro'>iVMP</abbr> allows you to easily bring in Vocabularies like the <a href='http://www.iptc.org/NewsCodes/'>IPTC NewsCodes</a>, except in simple text format. They're easy to manipulate, and I've formatted the <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/files/IPTC_Scene.txt' title='IPTC Scene Vocabulary for iView Media Pro'>Scene</a> and <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/files/IPTC_Subject_Code.txt' title='IPTC Subject Code Vocabulary for iView Media Pro'>Subject Code</a> files that you can drop into (remove the underscores, or merge the files into your existing vocabulary files):</p>
<p><code>~/Library/Application Support/iView/Plug-ins/Vocabulary/Default/</code></p>
<p>Maybe I'll put together a quick viewer or formatting utility if there's interest.  </p>
