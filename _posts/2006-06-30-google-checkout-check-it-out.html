<p>So <a href='https://checkout.google.com'>Google Checkout</a> (not GBuy, or g'bye) has hit the streets. You can go and see the <a href='https://checkout.google.com/seller/developers.html'>Google Checkout Developer API</a> to intergrate it into your own web-applications.</p>
<p>Interesting note, this is one of the first Google service in awhile that wasn't <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/print/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060629_411177.htm'>rolled out as "Beta"</a>. I guess it's one thing for users to understand that their email/calendar/maps may be wrong. But don't be messin' with my money!</p>
