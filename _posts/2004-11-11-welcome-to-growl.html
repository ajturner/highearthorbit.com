<p>So I just wrote my first menulet: <a href='projects/geolocation/Geolocation.tgz'>Geolocation</a> and I wanted to add something a little 'prettier'. I had seen something similar, but couldn't remember it's name. Well, I saw it again: <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl!</a>. </p>
<p>Now to see how I can implement the API calls. Should be 'straight-forward'. ;)</p>
