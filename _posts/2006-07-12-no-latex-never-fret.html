  content: "Hi Andy,\r\n\r\nThis is Nicole.  I was just checking to see if they posted
    that you won the mapquest contest (BTW Congrats!) and I checked out your blog.
    \ Cool - ironically I am in the process of writing a big document and your referencing
    suggestion helped.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nI hope you're doing well.  Tell Corrie I said
    hello.\r\n\r\ntake care,\r\nNicole D."

<p>So you're writing a paper with citations and you're wishing you had LaTeX's beautiful self-referencing ability to your list of references. However, for whatever reason, you're stuck using Microsoft Word. And clicking through <em>Insert</em>-><em>Reference</em>-><em>Cross-reference...</em>, then scroll to find your article, and set to paragraph number, etc. has got you really down.</p>
<p>Bet you didn't know about field codes. Instead, just put your cursor in your citation brackets (or whatever you use), press <em><ctrl></em>-F9, and then <code>REF NameYear \n</code>. </p>
<pre><code>... demonstrated in on an airship [{REF Turner02 \n}].</code></pre></p>
<p>The <code>\n</code> specifies that you want the paragraph number of the reference, which equates to the ordered-list number. Later, in your references section, you will <em>Insert</em>-><em>Bookmark</em> and properly name your citations (again, I use NameYear). You then need to hit <em>Alt</em>-<em>F9</em> turn 'hide' all the field codes in your doc and update and they'll all be linked.</p>
<p>It's not pretty, it's not LaTeX (not that LaTeX is pretty either), but it works.</p>
