<p>Since I finally had a wochenende free, I decided to <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5'>upgrade</a> to the newest Wordpress. Probably not necessary, but I wanted to start fiddling with the <a href='http://www.asymptomatic.net/archives/2004/12/21/1188/geo-plugin/'>Geo plugin</a> for some functionality ideas I had, and didn't want to do so on old code.</p>
<p>Therefore, the layout is a little different at the moment as the default "Kubrick" (find your own damn link, there's about a million) which I will be modifying up. Can't be all vanilla like. Sorry for the momentary disruption. You may return to your own reality. :)</p>
