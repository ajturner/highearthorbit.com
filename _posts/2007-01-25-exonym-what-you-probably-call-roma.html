    we've done it for millennia).  Nice to know they have terms for this. \r\n\r\nAs
    we become a more connected world, it seems like we'd be better off using endonyms
    whenever possible, but I guess databases of matches is a good start."

  content: "You're right that it would be interesting and beneficial to culture to
    return to the Exonyms. However, sometimes the 'local' name may be in conflict
    between locals.\r\n\r\nAnd teaching visitors and interested people the endonym
    will help make the name more common outside the region. I try to use the endonym
    whenever I travel, but I also know for a little while I completely butcher the
    pronunciation. :)"

    \"M&Atilde;&frac14;nchen\", as most of us live in a world where there aren't (important)
    towns with the same name everywhere. ;)"

<p>I was intrigued by the concept of <a href="http://earthcode.com/blog/2006/12/location_vs_locality.html" title="Location vs. Locality">Location vs. Locality</a> posed at <a href="http://earthcode.com">EarthCode.com</a>. Location is the latitude and longitude that mark a spot, or the address of a building. Locality is the 'area' that is local to you, and is much less defined: downtown Detroit, Northern Virginia, East Coast. </p>
<p>Locality also varies scope depending on what you're talking about. Are you physically going to a restaurant? You probably are looking fairly close. Do you want an update on news? Then the larger metro area is more interesting. Weather? You're looking at national regions (or local too, if you live near interesting geographical features). </p>
<h3>But what do you call it?</h3><br />
To add to the concept, or confusion, is what people refer to these localities as. Is it: NoVA ('no-vah'), Northern Virginia, or just DC? And what would a tourist guide from Madagascar refer to it as?</p>
<p>Of course, English speakers are often have it a little easier because many locations have an English name - even if the location itself isn't an English speaking location. Of course, this happens all of the time in other languages as well for English locations. But you probably recognize Roma is Rome, and Espa&Atilde;&plusmn;a, is Spain. However, do you know where <em><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">Vereinigte Staaten</a></em> is? Or what about &auml;&cedil;&shy;&aring;&oelig;&lsaquo; (Zh&Aring;nggu&Atilde;&sup3;)? </p>
<p>We're constantly referring to locations by names we've given them and not as they're known by the people that live there. The term for giving a name for a location that isn't used by the locals at that location is an <em>exonym</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endonym" title="Wikipedia: Exonym">This is what Wikipedia has to say on the subject</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
An exonym is a name for a place that is not used within that place by the local inhabitants, or a name for a people or language, that is not used by the people or language to which it refers.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The name that a location is referred to by the locals is an <em>endonym</em>.</p>
<p>What is interesting looking at exonyms is that they are a marker of levels of foreign involvement in the region. As cities and areas became colonized or visited by outside people, they would typically be bequethed a name in the new language. Some of these names would just be used by the visitors, but in many cases, for long periods of time this exonym would be the official name of the city. For example, look at former Soviet states or India (Bh&Auml;rata Ga&aacute;&sup1;&Dagger;ar&Auml;jya). </p>
<p>There was a lot of this in New Zealand as well, where the Pakeha (Europeans) would bestow English names to the large ports and coastal cities. But as you venture out of the cities and leave Auckland or Christchurch, you start passing Whangarei, Tonagariro, or Oamarau. </p>
<p>For a demonstration of some variations of the names in Europe, check out the <a href="http://lazarus.elte.hu/~guszlev/euro/" title="Interactive Map of EUROPE and database of exonyms">Interactive Map of EUROPE and database of exonyms</a>.</p>
<h3>We can all just get along</h3><br />
Internationalization of applications has long been a difficult task and subject. It is made even more relevant as the internet, and websites, becomes widely available in many more countries. Users speaking their native languages will want to view maps of their localities, using the endonyms, localized names. </p>
<p>This will be especially important for projects like OpenStreetMap that seeks to create a global map, for the people. There are projects in many other, non-English speaking, countries that are doing similar projects for their own regions, and presumably in their own languages. </p>
<p>And excellent example is the <a href="http://mumbai.freemap.in/">Mumbai FreeMap</a> that seeks to "develop an open-access spatial data infrastructure, and a set of simple tools and applications in localised in Indian languages, for knowledge transfer and participatory urban planning by communities and citizens in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region."</p>
<p>How do you find all the names for a location? Flickr geocoding leverages people's own terminology for location and maps it to a location. So a photo taken by an English speaker in Germany may be labelled: Germany, Munich. Whereas taken by a native German speaker may be labelled: Deutschland, M&Atilde;&frac14;nchen. Together, these tags describe the same location, but with the exonym and endonym.</p>
<p>So when developing web applications, in particular geographic services, keep in mind who your users will be and how they will use your tools. They may be locals and want to use their own names, or they may be visitors or virtual tourists and interested in learning more about the world outside their window. </p>
