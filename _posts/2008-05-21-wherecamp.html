  content: 'Thanks for introducing the Six de Bono Hats idea into the geo-privacy
    discussion. It''s frustrating when a conversation gets stuck in a gripe-loop,
    and I think this helped us talk about more than just fears and complaints. Maybe
    next time we can talk more about the how: How do we allow for privacy control
    and still innovate?'

  content: "@Audrey - I think FireEagle is one of the good examples paving the way
    of demonstrating how to handle privacy, personalization and authentication. This
    way users can individually decide how much \"innovation\" they're willing to play
    with at the cost of some privacy. They can then decide that a particular innovation
    may not be for them and centrally de-authorize that new service.\r\n\r\nSo developers
    are free to go crazy and try out new things and any user doesn't have to worry
    about the long-term affects of trying this service."

<h3>So many hats</h3></p>
<p>The most important thing I learned at <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/" title="WhereCamp wiki - alternative conferences for geohacker...">WhereCamp</a> actually had nothing to do with <em>geo</em>.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion leading up to Where2.0 and WhereCamp about the benefits of <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/Federating+OpenGeoData" title="WhereCamp wiki / Federating OpenGeoData">open data exchange</a> between a number of the geospatial repositories that are coming online to share and aggregate data. Both Sean Gorman of <a href="http://www.geocommons.com/" title="GeoCommons">GeoCommons</a> and <a href="http://openlocation.org">David Troy</a> spoke in their presentations about the importance and capability of interchange. </p>
<p>However, while the concept is easy - lets share data - there is a lot of difficulty in the specifics. 45 minutes in an ad-hoc session could very easily diverge into many channels of non-resulting vectors. </p>
<p>Instead, <a href="http://www.asklater.com/steve/" title="SteveC">Steve Coast</a> introduced us to a brilliant technique for investigating, analyzing, and brain-storming on difficult and potentially controversial issues. A technique that is perfectly adaptable to solving problems in short-time periods with a large group of people.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats" title="de Bono Hats - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Six de Bono Hats</a> is a process walking through various perceptions of problem solving. You preset a time limit on each, everyone in the group "wears" this hat and offers insight with this perception. After the fixed time, you move on to the next hat.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White hat</strong> (Blank sheet): Information & reports, facts and figures (objective)</li>
<li><strong>Red hat</strong> (Fire): Intuition, opinion & emotion, feelings (subjective)                 </li>
<li><strong>Yellow hat</strong> (Sun): Praise, positive aspects, why it will work (objective)                   </li>
<li><strong>Black hat</strong> (Judge's robe): Criticism, judgment, negative aspects, modus tollens (objective)        </li>
<li><strong>Green hat</strong> (Plant): Creativeness, Alternatives, new approaches & 'everything goes', idea generation & provocations (speculative/creative)      </li>
<li><strong>Blue hat</strong> (Sky): "Big Picture," "Conductor hat," "Meta hat," "thinking about thinking", overall process (overview)                             </li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>By using this technique, we were able to <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/Federating+OpenGeoData" title="WhereCamp wiki / Federating OpenGeoData">lay out a good path towards interoperability and interchange</a>. We acknowledged previous and current efforts in geospatial and non-geo domains and also the difficulties that will be faced. You can read the resulting notes here.</p>
<p>The technique was so successful I applied it at the <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/GeoPrivacy" title="WhereCamp wiki / GeoPrivacy">GeoPrivacy</a> session. It came in half-way through after I saw that the conversation for the first 30 minutes was turning into a ping-pong game of point-counterpoint with no real guidance or outcome. So we performed a much fore-shortened de Bono hats and came out with an adequate list of privacy concerns, and suggestions of future actions.</p>
<h3>A week passes</h3><br />
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stevec77/2503588672/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2371/2503588672_27ea058fea_m.jpg" alt="camping at the GooglePlex" style="float: right"/></a>With <a href="http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/" title="WhereCamp wiki - alternative conferences for geohacker...">WhereCamp</a> and Where2.0 2008 over, I completely collapsed on Monday morning. Having the two conferences back to back means that is an incredible concentration of experts and enthusiasts. There is also the follow-on of the well-packaged Where2.0 with the unwrapping to dig inside of WhereCamp that brings us back to innovating and collaborating. </p>
<p>It was a grueling but completely inspiring week. I'm not sure how the future will turn out, but I know I'm very excited about it.</p>
