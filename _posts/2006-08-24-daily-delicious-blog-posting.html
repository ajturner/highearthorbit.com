  content: Personally, I generally prefer a half-written paragraph to a list of links
    -- I prefer being able to subscribe to people's del.icio.us feeds separately from
    their weblog feed.  But then, I imagine a lot of readers don't know how to do
    that, so I can see how they'd prefer one RSS feed that includes *everthing*.

  content: "You definitely have a good point in that del.icio.us already offers feeds
    that users can subscribe to. But, as you also mentioned, most users probably don't
    know about that. Add to the fact that I would get my links on a link-by-link basis
    rather than as an archived dump.\r\n\r\nAt some point I'll move the daily postings
    to a sidebar feed or something."

    recognizer, email verificator, and a lot of other functions...\r\n\r\nBut. I forgot
    link to it :(\r\n\r\nCan you give me URL to the XRumer description? screenshots,
    etc.\r\n\r\nThanks"

<p>By popular demand (ok, one request), I am putting up instructions on how to have your <a href='http://del.icio.us/' title='del.icio.us'>del.icio.us</a> links posted daily to your blog.</p>
<p>I like this, as <a href='http://fofredux.sf.net' title='FoFRedux RSS Aggregator'>feed readers</a> then have a succinct list of interesting sites to show (rather than a sidebar, who <em>goes</em> to a blog anymore?). A list of links is often more interesting than some half-written paragraph of diatribe just to get to the point. (case in point).</p>
<h2>How to setup del.icio.us to post daily links</h2></p>
<ol>
<li>Log into <a href='http://del.icio.us/' title='del.icio.us'>del.icio.us</a></li>
<li>On the right-side, under "experimental", choose "daily blog posting"</li>
<li>Click "add new thingy" (yes, it really says "thingy", those crazy del.icio.users</li>
<li>Fill in the form as appropriate, here is an example:
<ul>
<li>job_name: DailyLinks</li>
<li>out_name: (blog user - e.g. delicious)</li>
<li>out_pass: (blog password for that user)</li>
<li>out_url: http://highearthorbit.com/xmlrpc.php</li>
<li>out_time: 3 (approx time to post, in GMT)</li>
<li>out_blog_id: (leave this blank) </li>
<li>out_cat_id: (category id, look at the id in your blogging software)</li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>Click "Submit Query"</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Sometime within the appointed hour (they're spaced out so neither del.icio.us's servers, or ping services, are flooded 'on the hour') your new links will be posted. </p>
<p>For this blog, I created a new user, gave that user Author privileges, and created a specific category, <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/category/bookmarks/' title="HighEarthOrbit BookMarks category" rel="me">bookmarks</a></p>
