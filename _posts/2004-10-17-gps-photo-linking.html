<p>Jeffrey Early has made a nice little app called <a href='http://oregonstate.edu/~earlyj/gpsphotolinker/'>GPSPhotoLinker</a> which is the Mac solution for syncronizing GPS track information with image EXIF data. </p>
<p>Also, his app points to <a href='http://home.arcor.de/ahuggel/exiv2/'>Exiv2</a> which is a C++ library for editing image exif data. </p>
