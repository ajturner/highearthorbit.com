  content: "Hrm, that's unfortunate. I guess I was misinformed. I'll be in Stratford-upon-Avon
    during the week.\r\n\r\nAnything else interesting going on in London or environs
    on the weekend?"

In the past few months I <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/locaction-reboot-11" title="Loca(c)tion - Reboot 11">spoke at Reboot11</a> in Copenhagen, was wowed by the progress of the OpenStreetMap community, tools, and data at <a href="http://www.stateofthemap.org/" title="State Of The Map 2009">State of the Map</a>, and did a little preparatory GIS <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2009/08/03/a-hot-time-at-geoweb-2009/" title="James Fee GIS Blog &Acirc;&raquo; Blog Archive &Acirc;&raquo; A Hot Time at GeoWeb 2009">t&Atilde;&ordf;te-&Atilde;&nbsp;-t&Atilde;&ordf;te</a> at <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/geoweb-standards-intro/" title="GeoWeb Standards '&ldquo; Intro :: High Earth Orbit">GeoWeb</a>.</p>
<p>This was perhaps most summarized by the experience at Gov2.0 Summit. The conference, held in DC but led by O'Reilly and TechWeb saw the convergence of technorati with government agencies, and beltway consultants. There was Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sitting next to Vint Cerf - old and new, talking about government leveraging social and internet tools - and then the White House's Macon Phillips, Aneesh Chopra and Vivek Kundra talking about revolutions within the agencies themselves.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/where20gov20-gov20-summit" title="Where2.0+Gov2.0 - Gov2.0 Summit">share my thoughts</a> and our work with various agencies and their ability to leverage location and geospatial tools as a common collaboration point between citizens and government agencies and municipalities. Besides, it's always fun to follow Jack Dangermond on stage.</p>
<h3>Upcoming Events</h3></p>
<p>Of course, summer isn't over. Next Monday I am speaking about geospatial search at the EPA Search Summit here in DC. Then heading over to UK to <a href="http://www.agi.org.uk/conference/aboutevent.asp" title="Association for Geographic Information : AGI Conference : About the Event">AGI Geocommunity'09</a> to really <a href="http://geothought.blogspot.com/2009_09_01_archive.html" title="geothought: September 2009">discuss</a> the current state, and <a href="http://www.agi.org.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_AGI_ABOUTART_74/_page.xsl/95&amp;xsl_arg=//BF%5FAGI%5FAB%5FA%5FCONF/&amp;xsl_argx=5" title="Association for Geographic Information : AGI Conference : Conference Programme">possible futures</a> of geospatial technologies.</p>
<p>In general, AGI Geocommunity looks like a great <a href="http://www.agi.org.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_AGI_ABOUTART_74/_page.xsl/95&amp;xsl_arg=//BF%5FAGI%5FAB%5FA%5FCONF/&amp;xsl_argx=5" title="Association for Geographic Information : AGI Conference : Conference Programme">lineup of talks</a>. The different perspectives of problems (UK postcodes &amp; MasterMap anyone?) and solutions (OpenStreetMap did emerge from the UK) is very enlightening.</p>
<p>While in England - I just may hop up to Oxford Geek night on Saturday, September 26 and try and foment some more interest in <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" title="CrisisCommons Wiki">CrisisCommons</a> and CrisisCampUK. Let me know if you're around - it would be great to meetup.</p>
