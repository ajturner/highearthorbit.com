<p><a href='http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001096.html'>Defense Tech</a> has pointed out there is a bill up in the US Senate to ban the distribution of commercial satellite imagery for 'security reasons'.</p>
<p>The <a href='http://www.fas.org/sgp/congress/2004/s2400-imagery.html'>bill is here</a>. An interesting view of <a href='http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/acda.htm'>High-Res commercial imagery & open-source information: Implication for Arms Control</a>.</p>
<p>I can't find information on when the vote is/was.</p>
