    ?\r\n\r\nI'd agree that the visual tools for displaying geographical content/data
    are become very commonplace on interactive platforms but it still feels to me
    that the UX/design community has plenty of challenges ahead in making people
    feel comfortable when using these rich interfaces.\r\n\r\nI've seen too often
    that developers/designers get very focussed on the possibilities of using
    maps/mapping and lose sight of the most important bit - making the most of
    the content or data."

  content: "I agree on all accounts. Especially that there is still a lot of UX/Design
    effort that has to work to help guide the future of these tools. A mixture of
    GIS, Cartography, Interaction Design, and Usability have to converge together.
    \r\n\r\nThere is currently a (hopefully) falling wall of \"slap maps on sites\"
    just for the sake of maps. Interaction designers are thinking now about what the
    purpose of a particular map interface is: search, exploration, visualization,
    etc. and then design the interface appropriately.\r\n\r\nRegarding the general
    \"public desire\" for maps, looking at the interest in using light-weight placemarking
    tools for quick dropping of points or hikes demonstrates this. At least, a rising
    trend for people being able to \"mark their territory\" whether it be literally
    bounds of their travels, or more psychogeographical demarcations (\"pretty sunset
    here\")"

<p>Branching out of geo-specific conferences, I attended the <a href="http://beyondbroadcast.net/blog/" title="Beyond Broadcast 2008: Mapping Public Media">Beyond Broadcast</a> conference yesterday. In it's fourth year, Beyond Broadcast is a one-day meeting of Public Media organizations, producers, and groups discussing the current state and future directions of television, radio, video, interactive, and other mediums. </p>
<p>The theme this year was actually "Mapping Public Media" - so perhaps I cheated a little on going to a non-geo conference. However, only half the conference was specifically about mapping, or as many of the attendees considered more generally, visualization. </p>
<p>It is quite obvious the very prevalent impact and interest in mapping and geographic visualization of data. The tools have become approachable and the public comfortable, even expecting, rich cartographic interfaces and exploration. Also, being a US Election year, voting maps are obviously in high supply. </p>
<p>One major issue I raised with the current offering of maps in media is that they are created with Flash, which is acceptable for the powerful capabilities and unique interfaces. However, the underlying data that is being aggregated and collated isn't being shared. This is a primary issue because of the transparency and openness that is valued in public media. Similar to previous discussions on the importance of the government to share underlying data foremost and build portals secondary, I think it is important that public media organizations view the sharing of their data with the same priority as creating interfaces and analysis of the information. </p>
<p>Fortunately, names in the field like <a href="http://www.magiclantern.co.uk/" title="Magic Lantern Home">Paula Le Dieu</a> of Magic Lantern and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/" title="Online NewsHour | PBS">Lee Banville</a> of NewsHour are entirely on board and pushing this themselves. In fact, Paula even name-dropped OpenStreetMap and its efforts in providing open licensed geographic data that should be essential to public media organizations when evaluating their mapping solutions.</p>
<p>As an outsider it was interesting to gain the perspective of public media people. There is a striking resemblance to the Open-Source community. Public media has a high set of ideals and goals for the greater common good, while also wrestling with questions of funding, licensing, corporate interests, and impact.</p>
<p>An underlying question that arose several times was regarding the future place of public media bodies. There new competition isn't necessarily large media, but instead digital services such as YouTube, Flickr, NewsVine, and Google. These services allow for public engagement, curation, discovery, awareness, aggregation, and viewing. What is the purpose of an organization to perform the similar role?</p>
<p>One attendee discussed their value as a professional. They have the experience to qualify news, curate, build and disseminate. Instead of working against this rising tide of user-generated and shared media, they should be working to provide their expertise in using this information. They should be engaging with groups inside of these services, providing links back from their organization's sites and articles to these larger bodies, and continuing to integrate their services with these new web applications. </p>
<p>Another answer lies in the inclusion of all communities, especially minority or disenfranchised groups. There were many jokes on the current composition of new and old media - but the general agreement is that there is a lack of diversity in many of these domains and a requirement for organizations to provide support and promotion of the works and ideals of these communities.</p>
<p>Again, this is similar to Open-Source. Because the specific need for large market desire and value is removed, developers and projects can work towards an ideal goal and address niche issues. In addition, because there isn't "lock-in", they are also forced to provide good service and applications to their users. </p>
<p>I'd like to see if Public Media could also follow Open-Source in discovering new methods of revenue generation. They've already been doing this by offering their content for free via one medium (radio, website) but then paying for this same content via disparate mediums (CD, podcast). This is the same as RedHat offering RH-Linux for free download, or pay for CD's, manual, and support. </p>
<p>Other potential options may include consulting or trading of knowledge between either companies or other organizations. Various public media entities have worked hard to develop new tools, methods of production, and evaluation of markets - this information and techniques have value.</p>
<p>Thanks for the enlightening and thought-provoking discussions. It's great to meet both users of, as well as new concepts for, mapping tools and interfaces.</p>
