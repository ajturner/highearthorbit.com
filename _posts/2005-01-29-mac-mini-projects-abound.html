  content: What's the problem with the A/V? I thought you'd be able to run mirroring
    through the port. Is this PCI not supported?

  content: "No, the A/V ports, for whatever reason, don't work under OS X. At
    least, that was the official Apple word when I checked about a year ago when we
    installed OS X. The PCI works, so it would be possible to get a TV Out card.\r\n\r\nAs
    for MythTV, Nigel has a link to the DarwinPorts version (<a href='http://www.users.bigpond.com/pear_computers/'>link
    here) that includes an installer and is 'idiot proof'.</a>"

  content: "From a while back, there is this discussion on AVSForum that discusses
    using the Firewire SDK plus D-VHS to record HDTV streams.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/printpost.php?postid=3616279\r\n\r\nI
    suspect you'll need something in addition to the AV card, however. Nothing online
    indicates that Apple has provided this functionality with subsequent updates.
    Not a surprise, since the system requirements are probably outstripping the abilities
    of the 333 mhz G3. Mind you the Pismo worked fine with sufficient RAM.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macintouch.com/mediaserver01.html

  content: The HackTV demo has, suprisingly, been part of the example applications
    since 10.1 I believe. Just hasn't caught much attention until recently with the
    advent of DVR Macs.

<p>There is a new <a href='http://mrzippy.org.uk/macmediacenter/'>Mac media center projects page</a> (via <a href='http://engadget.com'>Engadget</a>), which covers all you may need to know to fully deck out your mini for media center goodness. Well, I guess it really applies to *any* mac. Hrm, I wonder what the minimum reqs for running <a href='http://mythtv.org'>MythTV frontend</a> are on a mac.</p>
<p>Thanks to a certain cool aunt of <a href='http://greenroof.highearthorbit.com'>my girlfriend's</a> her original G3 mac has no immediate use. Mayhaps another TV frontend? A big problem is, however, that the S-Video out on the A/V card (excellent addition to a a computer IMHO) does not currently work under OS X and there isn't a DVI out to use the S-Video dongle on. A puzzle to be sure...</p>
