<p>So, in curling, like most other sports, there is an object that you, the player has possession of, in which the objective is to place that objective in a specified location. The object and location are largely what varies from sport to sport, as well as the mechanism for transporting this object. For example, Soccer (football) has a sphere, which can only be kicked, and should go into a net. By other example, curling has a stone, which may only be pushed behind a certain line on the ice, and then should come to rest closest to the center of the <em>house</em> on the other side of the ice.</p>
<p>Like baseball or basketball, curling measures "shot percentage". This is the percentage of the time the player "makes their shot". Now curling isn't as definitive as say, a baseball player earning a base, or a basketball player making a shot. It's more... subjective. When the skip called for a stone to be "a guard", how do you measure that? </p>
<p>For example, lets look at the 1998 Winter Olympics Gold match between Sweden and Canada:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 MEN<br />
 Gold Medal<br />
 Switzerland 9 Canada 3<br />
 Switzerland<br />
 Team: 81%.<br />
 D. Perren:  89%<br />
 D. Mueller: 86%<br />
 P. Loertscher: 72%<br />
 P. Huerlimann: 78%<br />
 Canada<br />
 Team: 64%<br />
 G. Karrys: 98%<br />
 C. Mitchell: 73%<br />
 R. Hart: 58%<br />
 M. Harris: 25%<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>So, Sweden won over Canada. And looking at the shot percentages, it's pretty apparent why this happened. Strategy counts for a big portion of curling, like any sport. However, if you can't make the shots, strategy goes right out the window. In fact, with the Canadian Skip making only 25% of his shots, this game was pretty much a blowout. Maybe the Skip and Lead should have switched spots. :)</p>
