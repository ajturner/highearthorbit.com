<p>It appears as though there are numerous mis-locations of European counties (esp. Czech Republic) showing up in the Netherlands or Marina Del Rey, California. I believe this is because a large number of the IP-address blocks must have been assigned to these ISPs. The similar affect occurs for North American unknown IPs often appearing in Australia. </p>
<p>Your hostname is a decent correcting factor, however, more work is necessary to provide better resolution than country.</p>
