  content: "I believe 20\" is perfect for business use.  Anything larger is inefficient.
    \ I had an argument with my manager who wanted to purchase 23\" screens for all
    staff downstairs.  As they have small desks the monitors are \"in-their-face\"
    and in my opinion is a workplace health &amp; safety risk.  We'd need an on site
    optometrist for weekly checkups.\r\nAt home though, 23\" would be fantastic."

    Thanks for the thoughts Juke - actually given that this post was written in 2005, monitor sizes have changed quite a bit. In fact at work I just bought our engineering team 24" widescreen monitors. The extra 300px to the side does help in having code documents and web pages up - but is quite "large & in charge".

    I'm sticking with my current Apple 22" Cinema display.

<p>At <a href='http://www.simcreator.com'>work</a> I recently got bequethed a <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http%3A//accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx%3FTabPage%3Doverview%26sku%3D320-4111%26c%3Dus%26l%3Den%26cs%3D19&ei=GlCKQpe1NI3O4QGmkJnmAg'>20" widescreen LCD</a>. I'm a big fan of the Dell LCD monitors, crisp, feature rich (dual inputs on 17", QUAD input on 20"). In fact, the 2005FPW got <a href='http://www.anandtech.com/displays/showdoc.aspx?i=2400'>great review</a>, and uses the same lcd panel as the Apple Monitor. If you can pick one up <a href='http://techbargains.com'>on sale</a> for as little as $380, I <b>highly</b> recommend it. </p>
<p>However, after setting it up and beginning to use it, I'm actually posed with the question: "Can a monitor be too big?" The answer is a decidedly... probably. I just moved up from a 17" to this widescreen monstrosity. I am actually at a loss for my data and I feel that I have to <em>swivel my neck</em> to take in the whole screen. </p>
<p>Another thing: Firefox under windows doesn't seem to play well with the ultra-wide resolution. I'm currently running at the LCD native 1680x1050. When I have the Firefox window in the far-right of the screen and bring down a menu, the url history or anything the responding menu appears about 1/3 way in from the right-edge of the screen. I think it's drawing methods must be 'confused'.</p>
<p>"Too big"? maybe not. "Absurdely huge"? definitely.</p>
