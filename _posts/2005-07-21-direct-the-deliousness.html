<p><a href='http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/'>Del.icio.us direc.tor</a> is a super-slick Ajax interface for managing <a href='http://del.icio.us/nilspace'>del.icio.us</a> bookmarks. </p>
<p>I've been using the <a href='http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious'>foxylicious</a> Firefox plugin which syncs my del.icio.us bookmarks to my Firefox bookmarks. However, that's limited to my desktop machine and also is a *lot* of bookmarks. </p>
<p>So, while I pull a GTD and bookmark sites I find interesting so I can subsequently forget about them rather than keeping them in a tab, wanting to read them, and then fretting because I forgot about it. </p>
