<p><a href="/assets/uploads/2007/02/icommunitytv.jpg" title="iCommunity.tv homepage" class="thumb"><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/02/icommunitytv.thumbnail.jpg" alt="iCommunity.tv homepage" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"></a><a href="http://blog.eparticipation.com/index.php?/authors/1-Chris-Haller">Chris Haller</a> has recently released a very cool new localized news video site, <a href="http://icommunity.tv/" title="iCommunity.tv">iCommunity.tv</a>. The site allows users to upload and geotag videos of their own news media around the world.</p>
<p>iCommunity.tv is a fore-runner in providing video media primarily centered around geography in addition to focusing on <a href="http://icommunity.tv/citizenjournalism" title="iCommunity.tv: What is citizen journalism?">citizen journalism</a> , and not just videos of crazy stunts and movies served up by other media sites. Users can create custom channels and collections based on their interests and locations.</p>
<p>They offer a GeoRSS feed and a KML feed of the postings - which means it works very well in your <a href="http://mapufacture.com">Mapufacture Maps</a>. See the <a href="http://mapufacture.com/georss/feed/show/876" title="Mapufacture: Latest News - iCommunity.TV">feed map</a>. Now you can add the feed to any of your Mapufacture maps to get update when a new video shows up in your community (or area of interest, for example where your family lives or you're going to take a vacation)</p>
<p>Lastly, under the hood, iCommunity.tv is built on top of the <a href="http://drupal.org" title="Drupal homepage">Drupal CMS platform</a> and is an excellent example of the power behind building a GeoCMS. In the future, Chris possibly plans to offer the ability for users to aggregate their video blogs through the service to allow for easier posting.</p>
<p>iCommunity.TV is a service of <a href="http://eParticipation.com">eParticipation.com</a></p>
