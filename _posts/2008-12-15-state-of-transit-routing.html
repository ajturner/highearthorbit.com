<p><a href="http://limnthis.typepad.com/" title="Limn This" rel="met">Jim Stogdill</a> and I had a conversation a week ago about the new iPhone 2.2 firmware that includes walking directions as well as similar projects in the space. In my <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/research/where2-report.html" title="Where 2.0: The State of the Geospatial Web | Research Reports | O'Reilly Radar" rel="me">Where2.0 Report</a> I talked about the convergence of mobile devices and the effect on multi-modal routing: your phone changing from auto to walking to metro directions based on your context. However, I didn't go in-depth on example projects and services.</p>
<p>Jim posted my notes of our discussion on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/the-state-of-transit-routing.html" title="The State of Transit Routing - O'Reilly Radar" rel="me">O'Reilly Radar</a>. So check them out there. It's just an overview, but let me know if I missed an interesting project or story about open-data (or lack of).</p>
