<p>While traveling for a couple of weeks around China I have been posting notes, and a "Travel Stream" over at <a href="http://location.highearthorbit.com/travel/" title="Andrew Turner Travel Blog">my travel blog</a>. It's primarily for my own travel journal of where I've been and thoughts along the way. It includes "meanwhiles", which are the flickr/twitter/etc. posts inserted in between the actual blog posts. That way even if I'm just putting up quick notes (tumblog style) or photos, they still show up in the blog stream. </p>
<p>Using GeoPress, I can add locations through the web interface, but I've also added in-body location tagging, such as including <code>GEOPRESS_LOCATION</code> or <code>geo:lat=</code> and <code>geo:lon=</code> to set the location. This makes it easy for me to use an offline editor like Ecto, or even Wordpress' email a post capability to easily post to my blog without necessarily having to login and use the web interface. I was hoping to have an N810, complete with built-in GPS, to take along, but unfortunately the developer discount codes aren't working yet, so I was <em>stuck with</em> my N800 and an old iBook. </p>
<p>It's getting easier to create a travelog enroute by utilizing a number of tools and then aggregate these together. Another great example is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/bangladeshboat/">BBC's Bangladesh River Boat trip</a> that uploaded GPS tracks, photos, twitters. For some reason, the potentially very useful Plazes doesn't really fit into my workflow and I don't find it very easy to update my locations quickly. Perhaps I need to investigate the API and make a simple offline widget for building up a set of travelled locations that can sync when I get back online.</p>
<p>More thoughts on China and travel soon. </p>
