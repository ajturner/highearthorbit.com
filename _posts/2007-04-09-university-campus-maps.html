  content: Arizona State University has a Google Maps Mashup that works pretty well.  Since
    Google has offices on ASU property, it isn't unexpected, but the same thing could
    be done without much difficulty as you point out with open layers.

<p>Why is it that most major universities maps are still relegated to the old scanned paper copy? Check out the beauty that is <a href="http://www.umich.edu/news/Maps/ccamp.html" title="University of Michigan's Central Campus Map">University of Michigan's Campus map</a>. It's amazing that a major university still uses GIF images for their campus maps.</p>
<p>Now, they know what mapping is, check out their cool <a href="http://mbus.pts.umich.edu/arrivals/index.php" title="University of Michigan Magic Bus Map">transit services</a>. There is even a <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/image/solstice/sum06/Gloobe.html" title="3D Atlas of Ann Arbor: The Google Earth Approach">3D Atlas of Ann</a> <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/search?tags=3D+Atlas+of+Ann+Arbor" title="GoogleEarth 3D Catalog: 3D Atlast of Ann Arbor">Arbor in Google Earth</a>.</p>
<p>It's not hard to make this into a more usable dynamic map. I used the <a href="http://labs.metacarta.com/rectifier">MetaCarta's Map Rectifier</a> to take the campus map image, rectify it using several control points (intersections and circles work great for this) and created a <a href="http://labs.metacarta.com/rectifier/rectify/165">slippy campus map</a>.</p>

<p>You can play with the actual <a href="http://mapsomething.com/demo/campus/">Campus Map here on MapSomething</a>. The next steps would be searchable campus directory, click on buildings to get info on rooms, open times, phone numbers, a way to upload your schedule and have it plan out your route, etc. </p>
<p>Maybe I should send this on over to the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/future-home/index.htm" title="Umich School of Information">School of Information</a> or the <a href="http://cic.si.umich.edu/" title="Community Information Corps">Community Information Corps</a></p>
