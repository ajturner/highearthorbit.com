<p>Five months and a day after the release of 0.16 release of MythTV, the 0.17 release of MythTV is now available. Honestly though, what's with the 0.x release? MythTV, which not without problems is really a version 1.x product. The common act of software projects keeping themselves version numbering < 1 until some *golden moment* seems silly. They're really underselling themselves. Of course, mighty powers such as <a href='http://google.com'>Google are subject to this shortcoming themselves (as evidenced by the amount of Google-beta projects)</p>
<p>However, looks like a good release. The Changelog itself must be swamped or something, because the link is broken at the moment. They're touting the Mac OS X frontend (which does in fact, work great under 0.16). However, I guess one sign that the product is <1 is that each version seems to have some quirky UI changes. This could be as simple as adding some configuration screens, or button names, or as complex as, say, replacing the entire television guide backend. Now that my entire TV viewing experience happens no earlier than 2 seconds behind transmission time, I walk the line of upgrading with trepidation. </p>
<p>I've also learned my collective lessons and usually wait about a week before even *considering* an upgrade to the newest version. This allows all the relatively high-level bugs to shake themselves out. Also, I'll be waiting for an <a href='http://bit.blkbk.com/'>XBox mythtv frontend</a> release. Couple this with the fact that I will be gone on travel all of next week and don't want to leave certain *addicted people & pets* without their certain <a href='http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C156,00.html'>charming</a> <a href='http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/'>shows</a>. I also have a bunch of other <a href='http://highearthorbit.com/project'>projects</a> going on at the moment, and nothing terribly lacking in my current MythTV setup. The upgrade will have to wait until early March more-than-like.</p>
