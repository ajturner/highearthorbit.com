  content: "Andrew,\r\n\r\nJust stumbled upon your blog via Planetgs.com.  I took
    notice since the map you displayed was almost pointing to my house in Walled Lake!
    :-)  Nice blog from what I've read to date.  I've been looking into open source/mash-up
    stuff for a while now and I'll be checking out your gadget descriptions...even
    though you use Mac! ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n-Matt"

<p>I usually lament that the MidWest has a dearth of technology conferences (that aren't directly associated with automotive at least). However, I was very surprised to find out that just several miles away, next week there is the <a href="http://www.telematicsupdate.com/mobile/index.shtml" title="Mobile Location Enabled Services">Mobile Location Enabled Services conference</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.telematicsupdate.com/mobile/agenda.shtml" title="Mobile Location Enabled Services Agenda">agenda</a> looks really good, covering topics such as mobile-social networks (<a href="http://del.icio.us/tags/mososo" title="del.icio.us bookmarks tagged 'mososo'">mososo</a>), user-centric mobile navigation, and the legal and monetization aspects of LBS. Speakers are from Symbian, <a href="https://loopt.com" title="Loopt">Loopt</a>, Cingular, <a href="http://where.com" title="uLocate WHERE widgets">uLocate</a>, and a lot more.</p>
<p>So, sounds like a good warm-up to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/where2007/" title="O'Reilly's Where2.0 conference">Where2.0</a> and also maybe bang on some carriers/providers and their lack of opening up their API's to LBS developers. (unlike Sprint, which is ahead of the learning curve so far)</p>
