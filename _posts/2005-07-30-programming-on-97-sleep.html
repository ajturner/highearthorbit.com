<p>I got 4 hours and 15 minutes of sleep last night - and I feel great. </p>
<p>This may sound odd, but I'm currently attending the <a href='http://adhocconference.com/'>Ad-Hoc/MacHack Programming Conference</a>. It's a 4-day fest of sessions, papers, and tons of <a href='http://www.adhocconference.com/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/PastShows/Showcase'>hacks</a> .</p>
<p>And by hacks, I mean setting your display on fire (graphically), replacing fast user switching with a spinnable cube, controlling hardware devices (like robots) via graphical buttons, and making all of your windows translucent. I have been working on 3.42 hacks (2 of my own and assisting several others). I'll post them up when I get done.</p>
<p>I also got to hear some great talks by Jon Hubbard, the head of BSD (and founder of FreeBSD) and now security at <a href='http://apple.com'>Apple</a> and Andy Ihnatko, and upcoming "Industry Luminary". Andy had some excellent insights into the future of Mac OS X and devices and User Interfaces in general.</p>
<p>So yes, 7 hours of sleep in 3 days as of yesterday. So the 4 hours of sleep alone last night was excellent. </p>
