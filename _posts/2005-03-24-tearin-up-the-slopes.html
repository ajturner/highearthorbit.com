<p>Got a chance to ski <a href='http://www.skiloveland.com/'>Loveland Ski Resort</a>, west of Denver, CO.  Good bowls, not very difficult, but fun nonetheless. Really great tree snowboarding too, when you can miss the trees. :)</p>
<p>Of course, just as we were getting off the slopes, a complete whiteout hit the slopes and there were lightning strikes. I didn't know lightning could <a href='http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/13646/111679'>strike in a snowstorm.</a></p>
