    write in the fitness industry and one pretty cool development is integrating Google
    Maps with fitness equipment so that people can actually replicate terrain on treadmills
    and exercise bikes.  I understand this isn't your field exactly, but it does illustrate
    the breadth the GeoWeb offers for practical uses."

  content: The interesting part of your talk is crowdsourcing. I have first heard
    of crowdsourcing from my boss and he has told me its advantages such as getting
    the work done for cheap and gives more value for money. I have then realized that
    it is a great marketing tool especially for outsourcing and head hunting.

<p>I'm also giving a talk in the afternoon on Tuesday at GITA about crowd-sourced and volunteer crisis response. I will be discussing the history behind GeoCommons as a means for fast, collaborative map production and analysis, and the amazing work by the global communities such as OpenStreetMap, CrisisMappers, CrisisCommons, Ushahidi, and others as it applies to the advancement of geospatial technology and where it's leading.</p>
<h3>Camp Time!</h3></p>
<p>In talking with the GITA organizers about the communities that responded to Haiti, and in general the ground-swell around technologists in crisis response, they were interested in supporting a CrisisCamp as part of the Conference. So I'm excited to say that there will be a <a href="http://crisiscommonsgita.eventbrite.com/" title="Online Event Registration '&ldquo; Sell Tickets Online with Eventbrite">CrisisCamp in Phoenix</a>, Arizona on the Sunday, April 25th before the conference at the convention center. You can register at the <a href="http://crisiscommonsgita.eventbrite.com/" title="Online Event Registration '&ldquo; Sell Tickets Online with Eventbrite">EventBrite page</a></p>
<p>Obviously with so many geospatial people around, it's going to be very map focused. It's a great opportunity to look at some of the possible integration of the crowd-sourced data and community tools into more traditional, and analytic, platforms. In CrisisCampDC, volunteers such as Scott Broo did a slope analysis of LIDAR data in analyzing IDP camp placement and potential flood areas. How would GIS experts coordinate with the larger CrisisCommons community to identify and support these types of efforts. What are the other potential uses of LIDAR, remote imaging, surveying, mobile reported data, field analysis and paper map printing. And beyond just maps, we'll be picking up on the number of <a href="http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Projects" title="Projects - CrisisCommons Wiki">CrisisCommons projects</a> that continue to grow and evolve. And if you have ideas, suggest some or discuss on the <a href="http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/CrisisCamp_Phoenix" title="CrisisCamp Phoenix - CrisisCommons Wiki">CrisisCamp Phoenix Wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a technologist, volunteer, geospatial expert, NGO, government, or just interested, sign up and stop by and join the community! I hope to see you at <a href="http://crisiscommonsgita.eventbrite.com/" title="Online Event Registration '&ldquo; Sell Tickets Online with Eventbrite">CrisisCamp GITA Phoenix</a>, or at the conference itself.</p>GEOPRESS_LOCATION(Phoenix Convention Center, Phoenix, AZ)</p>
