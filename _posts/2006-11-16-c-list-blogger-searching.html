<p>w00t, I'm a --- wait, that's low right? <a href="http://www.kineda.com/?p=1166"><img src="http://www.kineda.com/bloglebrity/clist.png" alt="C-List Blogger" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px"/></a></p>
<p>Now how do I compare to those around me (vs. globally) - or within my "genre"? not that real "ranking" matters, but in general having 'authoritativeness' in search results is very useful, and supposedly how the back-end algorithms at Google (and I'm sure many other search engines) work. The more link-love you get from authoritative blogs, then the higher ranked you are.</p>
<p>Now, if this is the case, why when I search for various howtos and problems in programming do I just get links to Forum posts asking the same question, but not to the blog entry, IBM/Apple doc or whatever with the solution? </p>
<p>I want something like Amazon's: 37% of the people that viewed this product, bought this other product</p>
<p>But instead, I want: 70% of people that viewed this webpage, found their solution (stopped searching) by going to this other webpage. </p>
