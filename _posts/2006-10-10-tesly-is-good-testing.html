It installs as a plugin in your Rails application. Whenever you run <code>rake</code> to test your app, it uploads the results automatically to the Tesly Jr. server.</p>
<p>Using Tesly Jr., its very easy to keep your development team up to date with the status of the project. Combine this with <a href="http://blog.testingrails.com/2006/9/4/running-tests-on-deploy-with-capistrano" title="Testing Rails blog">runing tests on deploy</a> with Capistrano (via <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/5/running-tests-on-deploy" title="Jamis Buck Weblog">Jamis Buck</a>) and you have a that much better integration of testing into your development and release cycle. </p>
<p>Tesly Jr. is free when using the hosted service, and available for just $24 if you want your own copy to run on your own systems. </p>
