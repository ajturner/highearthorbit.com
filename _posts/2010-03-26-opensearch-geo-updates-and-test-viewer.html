<p><img src="http://unlockdata.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/opensearch-edinburgh.png?w=300&amp;h=150" style="float:right" />Progress still continues with the broad adoption of the OpenSearch-Geo extensions <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/opensearch-geo-and-time-extensions/" title="OpenSearch Geo and Time extensions :: High Earth Orbit">written at WhereCamp</a> just about 3 years ago. The current OGC OWS-7 testbed is considering many ways in which to integrate OpenSearch-Geo into catalog services and part of the official OGC architecture.</p>
<p>Specifically, Pedro and Jo have done great work getting the <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft_1" title="Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft 1 - OpenSearch">community supported specification</a> written into OGC format. You can read his excellent article <a href="http://geoportal.dlsi.uji.es/OpenSearch/docs/SIGLibre-OpenSearch-article.pdf" title="">outlining the proposed modifications</a>. Simple modifications include changing the <code>geo:locationString</code> to <code>geo:name</code> and also adding a <code>geo:geometry</code> to use more complex geometries than a simple <code>polygon</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to chime in on the conversation, join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensearch/browse_thread/thread/efaac36185fd610/3c251b44a4620e44?lnk=gst&amp;q=geo&amp;pli=1" title="Geo and Time Extension Schemas - OpenSearch | Google Groups">OpenSearch mailing list</a>, leave a comment here, or come to a WhereCamp, such as the one in Mountain View next weekend, to discuss it with the community.</p>
