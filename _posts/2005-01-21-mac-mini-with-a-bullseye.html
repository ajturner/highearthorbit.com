<p>I hadn't really thought of the venue, but after reading on <a href='http://techbargains.com'>Techbargains</a> (well, if 'shopping' can be akin to reading) that the Mac Mini is currently available from Target.com for <a href='http://www.techbargains.com/tellafriend2.cfm/39697'>$450 after 10% rebate</a> I started thinking about another placement of the Mac Mini.</p>
<p>Target has sold iPods in the past, and often limited their discounts to not apply to these, assumedly, low margin items. This isn't the case with the Mac Mini, probably because this is  the first Apple Target is selling. Which then made me realize, the Mini is now priced to compete on store shelves in places like Target, Walmart, etc. I mean, who buys a computer at a "department store"? Well, someone with onlly a $500 computer budget, that's who. </p>
