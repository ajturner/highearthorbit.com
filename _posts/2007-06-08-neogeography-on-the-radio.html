<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/06/imittlogo.gif" align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" alt="IMI Tech Talk Radio Logo"/>Last (last) month - I did an interview on <a href="http://techtalk.imi-us.com" title="IMI Tech-Talk Radio">IMI Tech-Talk radio</a> discussing my O'Reilly Shortcut <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/neogeography" title="O'Reilly Catalog: Introduction to Neogeography" rel="me">"Introduction to Neogeography"</a>. It was a great 30-minute coverage of my interests in geography and the geospatial web and a quick overview of some of the useful tools that have shown up and how users are using them. </p>
<p>The interviewer was in New York City, I am in Michigan, and the broadcast area is Phoenix, Arizona. So if you weren't in the area you probably missed it. Fortunately, they finally put up the archive just a week or so ago, so you can listen for free. </p>

<p>I haven't listened to the whole thing myself. It's that typical "my voice sounds weird" that makes it difficult to just sit back and enjoy. But I hope you do. Please let me know what you think.</p>
