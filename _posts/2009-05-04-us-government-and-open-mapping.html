<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/3500905270/" title="Delivering on Change - OSM in the WhiteHouse by Andrew Turner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3500905270_3cbf75f387_m.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 5px" width="210" height="240" alt="Delivering on Change - OSM in the WhiteHouse" /></a>This weekend, Tim Waters (chippy) noticed that <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/obama-white-house-support-openstreetmap/" title="Obama, White House support OpenStreetMap &Acirc;&laquo; thinkwhere" rel="met">the WhiteHouse is using</a> <a href="http://openlayers.org/" title="OpenLayers: Home">OpenLayers</a> mapping library and <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> basemap tiles in their new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/change/" title="Delivering on Change">Delivering on Change</a> page.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Whether you were already serving your country, or are responding to the President&acirc;&euro;&trade;s call, share how you are delivering on change in your community.Whether it is an hour per month helping those struggling in the current economy, tutoring kids in your neighborhood every day, or anything else, we want to highlight what Americans are doing to strengthen our country.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>This is very interesting on several levels. Foremost is the use of government provided (TIGER/Line) and crowd-sourced data (OpenStreetMap) in an official US Government Site. This is definitely an indicator that what were cutting edge tools have reached a critical mass to provide broad usability and appeal. Open Source? <em>check</em></p>
<p>Looking underneath the hood, the data is provided via a KML feed (<a href="http://whitehouse.gov/feed/kml/" title="http://whitehouse.gov/feed/kml/"></a>), so you can pull the data out and <a href="http://finder.geocommons.com/overlays/12315" title="Delivering on Change at GeoCommons Finder!">upload</a> or <a href="http://maker.geocommons.com/maps/5051?page=1" title="Delivering on Change at GeoCommons Maker!">map it</a> however you want. Open Data? <em>check</em></p>
<p>The site itself, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/change/" title="Delivering on Change">Delivering on Change</a>, is asking citizens to contribute stories and media about their personal engagement with change. This is an incredibly exciting step to ask for people to contribute to national storytelling and character. Citizen-sourced data? <em>check</em></p>
<p>The new US administration is continually doing amazing, and open, initiatives. There is incredible excitement around <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/" title="Recovery.gov">Recovery.gov</a> as a testbed for the next generation of transparency and embrace of technology and open data feeds.</p>
<h3>Small next steps</h3></p>
<p>My thoughts on interesting applications wouldn't be complete without pointing out a couple of suggestions. While many defend the default OpenLayers controls - I personally think that implementors should take that next step and apply minor customization to better integrate the look and feel of the map controls into their site. I've <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ajturner/beyond-google-maps-fowa-lo-presentation" title="Beyond GoogleMaps (SlideShare)">talked before</a> about how easy it is to change some CSS to replace the controls. Perhaps even just a darker blue background to match the White House blue in the logo. Customized?</p>
<p>Another, less highlighted but very important for Government sites is the integration of accessibility controls. OpenLayers supports <a href="http://mapsomething.com/demo/openlayers/examples/accessible.html" title="OpenLayers Accessible Example">map navigation using keyboard</a> inputs - which provides for alternative interfaces to navigate the map. It's not clear if this is official "508 compliant", but at least demonstrates the potential. Accessible?</p>
<h3>How you can help</h3></p>
<p>So do you want to help make Change, especially with mapping data and technology? Come join us at the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Washington_DC" title="Washington DC - OpenStreetMap">Washington, DC mapping party</a> - currently planned for June 20 + 21, 2009 somewhere in DC (details coming soon). Or join a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties" title="Mapping parties - OpenStreetMap">mapping party near you</a>.</p>
