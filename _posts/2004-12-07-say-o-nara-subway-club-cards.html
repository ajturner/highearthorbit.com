<p>So I'm buying me a good ol' Italian BMT on my way to <a href='http://detroitcurlingclub.com">curling</a> last night, and I notice a little placard ont he counter at the checkout. Apparently Subways are doing away with their "Subway Club Cards". </p>
<p>Curious, I asked the "Sandwich Specialist" why. Her response shocked me, but also made sense. Apparently there has been a brash of forged SubClubCards being sold on Ebay and Subway employees stealing cards and giving them to friends and stuff. Too many to deal with so they're just doing away with the cards.</p>
<p>It's times like these that I hate stupid people and how they ruin the world for the rest of us. </p>
