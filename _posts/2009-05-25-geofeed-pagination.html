<p>Erik Wilde was <a href="http://twitter.com/dret/status/1907880775">pondering</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  thinking of geofeeds where feed paging does not take you back in time, but increases the search radius. but how to specify paging semantics?<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>My first feeling is that 'zooming out' is not really a link. Pagination is just a crutch to deal with returning the full set of a single query in meaningful window sizes due to server response, bandwidth, client parsing, and maybe human interface. Zooming out implies actually performing a different search and would be a function of a client interface.</p>
<p>This mechanism is provided by <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft_1" title="Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft 1 - OpenSearch">OpenSearch-Geo</a>, which communicates how a client would use a bounding box or polygon search. Therefore a client interface could choose how to zoom out or in and has the capability to query the system this way.</p>
<h3>Feed Clusters</h3><a href="/assets/uploads/2009/05/feedlinkclustering.jpg"><img src="/assets/uploads/2009/05/feedlinkclustering-tm.jpg" width="271" height="169" alt="Feed Link Clustering" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /></a></p>
<p>However, I still could imagine more specific uses for such a concept. Erik's original idea is perhaps thinking more about using geography as a way to indicate limiting search set results. This might be done using clustering mechanism, such as k-means, similar to how one might view dense data on a map in clusters, but in search result feeds. The link elements would provide looking into any of these clusters, or <em>zooming in</em>.</p>

<h3>Structured clustering</h3></p>
<p>Another way this concept could work more literally would be to utilize a hierarchy, or several hierarchies, that a client may be able to easily snap to in order to query larger or smaller geographic areas. These hierarchies are not apparent in a simple search template and can provide more semantics to indicate the larger area rather than just simply "zoomed out".</p>
<p>For example, using the <a href="http://geotree.geonames.org/" title="GeoTree">GeoNames GeoTree</a> or <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/" title="Yahoo! Geo Technologies - YDN">GeoPlanet</a> woeid's, a search result could provide links from the specific bounding box query up to regional or districts that contain this query - as well as perhaps subsets contained within the bounding box.</p>
