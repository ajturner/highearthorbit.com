  content: "Yep, I actually wrote that about Midgard in this blog post and then removed
    it to keep the post just about this specific plugin. :)\r\n\r\nBut you're definitely
    correct that Midgard is leading the pack with implementing the ad-hoc GeoRSS spec
    first. "

<p>While traveling, its nice to be able to blog from a desktop application like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a> or <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. However, when you want to "geoblog", you want to add some more metadata than just the title, content, and some tags. </p>
<p>Geoblogging is just becoming more common, and the tools around it are figuring out what the user should be able to do. <a href="http://georss.org/geopress">GeoPress</a> provides a web interface for making maps and location for posts, but doesn't <em>yet</em> support additional metadata for setting the location via the XML-RPC interface that a blogging client would use. </p>
<p>One tool that adds geoblogging capabilities to ecto is this very informative Wiki on <a href="http://confluence.rave.ac.uk/confluence/display/SCIRC/Geo-Blogging">Geo-blogging extensions on Mac</a> that works for <a href="http://wiki.blojsom.com/wiki/display/blojsom/About+blojsom">Blojsom</a> based blogs. The site is a great resource on various tools and accessories for posting KML and GoogleEarth and GoogleMaps for geoblogging. </p>
<p>The tool works by bringing up GoogleEarth where you can spin, point, or reference an existing waypoint to choose the posting location. The plugin will then add the location metadata, a GoogleEarth KML Link, and also a screenshot of the location. Check out the <a href="http://confluence.rave.ac.uk/confluence/display/SCIRC/Geo-Blogging+Tool+Kit+-+Screencast+demo">Screencast</a> for a demo of how to use the geoblogging toolkit and its functionality. </p>
