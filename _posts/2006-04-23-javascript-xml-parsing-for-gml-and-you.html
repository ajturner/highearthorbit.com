  content: "Andrew,\r\nThe JavaScript security model does not allow XMLHttpRequest
    to get the XML from website other than the one hosting the JavaScript containing
    the XMLHttpRequest. The DOMParser.getElementsByTagNameNS method is nice, but in
    this case useless, because it can't see the XML from the HostIP website. Or do
    you have a workaround?"

<p>You find the need to determine the locations of your visitors, and you wonder how to do this? Surely it's impossible. Alas, it is not. Services like <a href="http://hostip.info">HostIP</a> provide the ability to locate your users given their IP address. The slick way to do this is via javascript. Unfortunately, the HostIP API doesn't provide a <a href='http://www.json.org/'>JSON</a> interface.</p>
<p>But of course, the response is in XML, so you're also wondering how to parse this XML response for something meaningful? The answer is the <code>DOMParser</code> and namespaces. There is a really nice function, <code>getElementsByTagNameNS</code> that allows you to parse out elements given a namespace. I kept trying <code>getElementsByTagNameNS("gml","name")</code>, which didn't work. The answer seems to be that you need to include a valid uri for the namespace.</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre>
var dom = new DOMParser ( ) .parseFromString ( responseText,<br />
                            "application/xml" ) ;</p>
<p>var location = dom.getElementsByTagNameNS (<br />
   "http://www.opengis.net/gml", "name" ) [1].firstChild.data<br />
    if location == " ( Unknown city ) "<br />
        return "";<br />
</pre><br />
</code></p>
