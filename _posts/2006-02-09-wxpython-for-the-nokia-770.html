<p><a href='http://n770.herraiz.org/>Connecting Geeks has an in-progress report on <a href='http://n770.herraiz.org/archives/18/'>porting wxPython and wxWidgets to the Maemo platform</a>. This is very awesome news. Back in the days, I've done my fair share of C++ programming. But I have just gotten increasingly tired of dealing with development environments, preprocessing, linking, and portability. I spend half of my development time staring a link lines for missing function references from unknown or incompatible libraries.</p>
<p>Rapid development of tools and applications with interpreted languages like Python or Ruby allows developers to get ideas and useful programs out instead of just giving up halfway. Furthermore, it's much easier to develop in a non-embedded environment or even on the device itself. This is why the <a href='http://www.forum.nokia.com/python'>Python for Series 60</a> phones and <a href='http://www.awaretek.com/pymo.html'>other devices</a> has been widely embraced.</p>
