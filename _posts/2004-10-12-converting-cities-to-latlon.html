<p><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names Online</a> is a really complete database of cities, regions, landmarks, etc. which gives their Lat/Lon, historical and modern significance and a bunch of other information. However, it's not really useable in an application as there is too much interface and would require 'scraping' - which I find distasteful.</p>
<p><a href='http://personal.cmich.edu/~franc1m/locamap.htm'>Maps & Tools</a> has a TON of map locations & other tools. May be nice for finding maps.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention before that the Geospatial Intelligence Agency has the <a href='http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/'>GEOnet Names Server</a>. This includes textfiles of all world cities and regions and geographic information.</p>
