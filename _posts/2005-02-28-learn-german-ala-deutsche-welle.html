  content: "In a modern world that is fast realizing the importance of being bilingual,
    there is a big rush to learn foreign languages. Spanish, French, Italian and German
    are the preferred languages that most people choose to learn. While Spanish is
    a very popular language among those choosing to be bilingual, German does not
    hold that kind of an appeal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.foreignlanguagereviews.com"

  content: "The problem is you start forgetting the language when you don't constantly
    use it. \r\nTo be able to really grasp it, you should live in Germany for at least
    one year and do courses at the same time to understand the structure of the language."

<p>I <a href='http://mythtv.org'>MythTV</a> the Deutsche Welle news broadcast in the mornings. And now, they've gone and put up their free <a href='http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,,2547,00.html.de'>Learn German</a> series. I guess it's a way to help English speakers learn German so they can watch more german news. Yay.</p>
