<p>Found a <a href='http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000H4C'>Thread at photo.net</a> where people suggest places to photograph (and hence probably visit in general) around the Michigan area.</p>
<p>I feel like I've neglected my time in the area and not given it a real chance, so I'll have to start going down this list and checking sites off.</p>
<p>And found out today our Admin Asst., who has lived in the area her whole life, has never been more than 10 miles west of where she grew up/lives.</p>
