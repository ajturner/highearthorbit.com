<p><a href='http://mapbuilder.sourceforge.net/'>mapbuilder-lib</a> is a browser based (AJAX) web mapping client for Open GIS Services. The tool set allows developers to provide map interfaces of arbitrary datasets without requiring the now <a href='http://maps.google.com'>infamous</a> <a href='http://maps.yahoo.com'>online maps</a>). It also supports <a href='http://mapbuilder.sourceforge.net/mapbuilder-lib-1.0-rc1/demo/timeSeries/index.html'>time series</a> maps (such as for weather, migration, travels) </p>
<p>The underlying server is available in both PHP and JSP, depending on your particularly preferred flavor. Hrm - no Ruby support. They could probably get a better headline if they provided the new programming language of the month(s). </p>
<p>I think having invigorated, open-source, web-based mapping tools is excellent. I also really like the time-series maps. I think I am going to try and use it for displaying GPS tracks from my bluelogger.</p>
