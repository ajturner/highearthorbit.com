<p><a href='http://www.mgmaps.com/'>Mobile GMaps</a> is a Java-J2ME application for phones which displays GoogleMap or Keyhole images and maps. Even better, it's distributed under a CreativeCommons license, but not for commercial use. </p>
<p>This looks like an incredibly useful application, and being done in J2ME makes it slicker than current Python applications (though no doubt more difficult to develop). The interface is pretty simple. It allows you to view, move, and zoom a map, view the satellite image, and search for a location. </p>
<p>A limitation of both the platforms speed/memory as well as the network speed make loading and translating maps rather slow. It's a very good demonstration, but the true usefulness will come when it's possible to view GoogleLocal information, tracks, waypoints, and automatically determine a location and display this on the map.</p>
<p>Example Use Case Scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show up in a city, search for "Hilton Hotel", and have the map show you the path/directions to your hotel.</li>
<li>Display nearby restaurants, highlight the desired one and via a menu, select "Call this Restaurant." The number is automatically dialed so you can make reservations on your way over.</li>
<li>Lead a user along a tour route, directing their travel. This is shown on the map. When the user gets to a location show them text about the location or an audio/video segment.</li><br />
</ol></p>
