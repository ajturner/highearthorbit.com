  content: "[...] I have been a traveling extensively over the last couple of weeks,
    so I am a bit behind in my entries. Last week I was at the Location Intelligence
    (LI) Conference and the Web 2.0 Expo. I met Andrew Turner, who gave the most lucid
    and informative talk on Neogeography that I have ever heard at Web 2.0 Expo. He
    and Mikel Maron gave a longer workshop on the subject at LI (missed that one,
    but I was at the Expo with the AWS crowd). One of our guys attended and said that

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2007/04/neogeographyslides.thumbnail.png" alt="Neogeography slides" align="right" hspace="5px"/> Here is the link to the presentation I gave Monday afternoon at the O'Reilly booth at Web2.0 Expo. It was a 45-minute quick-tour through Neogeography and cool tools/utilities/howtos that you should investigate more.</p>
<p><a href="http://mapsomething.com/presentations/Web2Expo_Neogeography.pdf">Web2.0 - Neogeography</a> (10MB, pdf). Measures at 86 slides. </p>
<p>I was bad and used some animations for changing images and showing examples. This doesn't work so well in PDF format. The links and primary material is still there. If something is unclear, just drop me a line and I can explain it, point to the source, or otherwise clarify.</p>
<p>This is just a small sample of what is discussed in the actual <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/neogeography" title="O'Reilly Catalog: Neogeography" rel="me">Neogeography Shortcut</a>, so I of course still recommend picking that up at the low-low price of $7.99. Much cheaper than the Web2.0 Expo was. :)</p>
