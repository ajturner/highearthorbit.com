<p>I put up some <a href='http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/1906'>code snippets</a> for a Location model in a Rails application. They include simple things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>degree< ->radians conversions</li>
<li>distance between two locations</li>
<li>Min/Max latitude & longitudes given a location and radius</li>
<li>Database queries for locations in a given range from a center point</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Essentially they're making up for not have a true GIS interface to the database running PostgreSQL and PostGIS. </p>
<p>Most of the functions actually came from another project, but I unfortunately lost the note, so if you can properly id the originator of some of the functions, please do! </p>
