<p><a href='http://ccablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/how-accurate-are-online-street-maps.html' title='How Accurate are Online Street Maps'>A really good comparison of the accuracy of various online maps</a> reminds us that we can't trust information just because it's "on the web". </p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy since the data is a direct reflection of the real-world and many of us rely on this data to get to our appointments, vacations, and friends houses. Everyone has a "MapQuest" story, but its not only MapQuest anymore. We must be suspect to any data online. It becomes particularly difficult, however, when we are required to aggregate data from <em>many</em> sources, where each source has some small bit of <em>truthiness</em>.</p>
