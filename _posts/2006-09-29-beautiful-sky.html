<p>Andri Snaer talks about how <a href="http://simnet.is/andri/">last night, all the lights were turned off</a> in INSERT_ADDRESS. Then a famous astronomer talked about the night sky over the radio for people to enjoy the natural beauty of the cosmos. </p>
<p>INSERT_MAP(200,400)</p>
<p>I think this is a simply marvelous idea. I've been in several European cities when they've had "Car Free days", most recently in Brussels during EuroOSCON. The idea is one day of the week that everyone will go car free, and enjoy the relative quiet and easy biking/strolling about town. </p>
<p>Overall, I am an <em>idealistic technocrat</em>. I really enjoy technology, gadgets, programming, etc. However, I also enjoy natural beauty and the environment as it is. I hope that towns here in the US start promoting these sorts of activities. I mean, what's the worse that can happen, people actually think its a good idea and turn off their lights at night? :)</p>
