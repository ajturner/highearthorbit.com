    wireless network scanner), you could easily include <a href=\"http://kismac.de\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">KisMAC</a> in the list, as it has excellent map importing,
    moving map display, and GPS track logging.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, gps2ge's home
    page is now located at http://www.grandhighwizard.net/gps2gex.html\r\n\r\nHave
    fun with the reviewing... it's certainly encouraging to see how many apps there
    are out there now!"

  content: Shayne, I believe that GPS should work if you buy a Keyspan USB-to-Serial
    adapter (the cable that comes with it connects the GPS to a serial port, not to
    a USB port... so you connect the included cable to the Keyspan adapter, and connect
    the Keyspan adapter to your computer).  Then it *should* work fine.  However,
    it's worth considering buying a cheap USB or Bluetooth GPS "mouse" such as the
    Holux GM-210 (USB) or GPSlim-236 (Bluetooth)... at least the USB one won't cost
    much more than a Keyspan, both are easier to put somewhere with a good sky view,
    and they both definitely work well with all Mac GPS software.

  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nsince this article was written there have been many changes
    to RouteBuddy, there are also many more to come. Currently RouteBuddy 1.3 is on
    offer and RouteBuddy 1.4 waits in the wings with many new features and greater
    connectability.\r\n\r\nThere are three main points to clear up here:\r\n1) Price\r\nEssentially
    you get what you pay for. \r\nRouteBuddy is the only modern up-to-date Digital
    Road Mapping application for the Mac and one whose feature set is growing all
    the time. There are many differences between us and the other applications listed,
    more below..\r\n\r\n2) RouteBuddy is a Road Map Mapping application, whereas the
    majority of the applications above are not. RouteBuddy also uses high quality,
    high definition and up-to-date vector-based road data from Tele Atlas whereas
    the others don't.\r\n\r\n3) RouteBuddy is unique. \r\nRouteBuddy has been built
    from the ground-up so that it will be able to use many types of maps, vector and
    raster for example, within the same application. To do the same with any of the
    above would mean buying more than one, maybe several applications, to suit all
    the data a user wishes to own and use and still not offer access to modern road
    map data.. \r\nRouteBuddy has been built to work seamlessly and easily  in a  'one
    app fits all' way.\r\n\r\nMore here from another posting: http://tinyurl.com/2obmk7\r\n\r\nIf
    you wish to know more then please visit our Forum to search, make comments or
    ask questions: http://forum.routebuddy.com/\r\n\r\nThanks for reading..\r\n\r\n\r\nNeil"

  content: Don't waste your money on RouteBuddy. You STILL can't buy Topo maps for
    half the states. The speed of mapping display reminds me of when I had a 286 running
    DOS. Whatever that program does to calculate routes is flawed. I tell it give
    the shortest route and it gives me the longest distance. I tell it give me the
    fastest route and the stupid software takes me off the interstate for no reason.
    No matter what I do, I can't keep the route on an interstate. The user interface
    is not intuitive at all and it will be a frustrating experience to learn how to
    use the software. There are plenty of alternatives available, many are FREE. Buyer
    Beware!

    other function, then we can usually sort these issues out if you contact support
    directly. Posting here is about as far from support as you can get, and then we
    can't help you, or any problems you have, at all. \r\n\r\nBTW - Free or cheaper
    software does exist but they don't have the features, support or even use vector
    road maps, let alone Topo maps.\r\n\r\nThe support email is: support@routebuddy.com\r\n\r\n\r\nNeil

<p><a href='http://www.routebuddy.com/index.html' title='RouteBuddy Homepage'>RouteBuddy</a> is a new GPS and mapping program of Mac OS X. It looks really slick, with a nice interface. They even promote the use for in-car navigation and mapping.</p>
<p>It's a little expensive, at $100, plus about $50 for each set of maps you want to buy for it. It seems like for $100, you should at least get 1 set of maps for free to start. This kind of pricing isn't really aimed towards a hobbyist or someone who just wants to 'play around' with maps.</p>
<p>There are numerous other mapping solutions for the Mac, none with as smooth an interface, but run much cheaper with similar functionality.  Here  is a quick list as well as their own blurb and pricing. </p>
