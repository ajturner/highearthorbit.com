<p>A very neat, and mostly unnecessary trinket, <a href='http://dog-e-tag.com'>Dog-e-Tag</a>.  Primarily, it's a digital storage for some simple text. However, what would really make this revolutionary would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmable from a cell phone - SMS messaging to the tag</li>
<li>GPS, when activated, will upload the location of the tag to a web server or message you on your cell phone</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Obviously, there is a design challenge of the small size and weight. </p>
