<p><a href='http://www.elasticspace.com/index.php?id=44'>Elastic Space</a> has a good reference on GPS photo-linking. Saw this while going back and checking in on all the days I missed at <a href='http://www.hackaday.com/'>Hack-a-Day</a>. </p>
<p>On a related note, the Engadget Pod-casts are pretty neat. I mean, nothing more than a couple of guys making amateur radio broadcasts, but they're geeks and talking about things that interest me. I think things like 'Podcasting' will really take off when it the content is not about the making of the content, but about 'other' things: fishing, investing, poltical news, etc. When a technology moves beyond the people that made the technology and is truly 'born'.</p>
