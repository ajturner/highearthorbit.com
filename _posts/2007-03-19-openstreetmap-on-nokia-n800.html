In fact, it's incredibly simple. Using <a href="http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/">MaemoMapper</a>, just add <code>http://tile.openstreetmap.org/%0d/%d/%d.png.</code> to your Map repositories.</p>
<p>This is nice in a couple of ways. First, MaemoMapper, and the underlying Maemo, are open-source applications. So it's nice to use open geodata. Second, using and caching Googlemap/Yahoo/et al. tiles is probably a violation of their Terms of Service, especially when you use them for realtime navigation. By using OpenStreetMap as the default mapping tile provider, MaemoMapper now provides a base functionality that is free for stringy ToS that could get it into trouble and question its existence. </p>
