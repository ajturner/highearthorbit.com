<p>I've gotten into this 'podcasting' thing. Though the name is a misnomer because 1) it isn't restricted to iPods, or pods of any nature, and 2) the last 2 podcasts by Engadget won't, for some foreign & mystical reason, play on my iPod. Go figure.</p>
<p>Really though, podcasting isn't anything more then either an amateur radio talk show, or maybe a regular audio journal/blog entry. However, it is nice to be able to get media on topics that interest me by people I find interesting. </p>
<p>Which brings me to my point. For podcasting to become mainstream, it needs to move beyond talking about the technology itself. It's like if there were only books on 'how cool books are', or a TV show on how to make, and broadcast, your own TV show. Not all that interesting beyond a small, immediate, and very odd, group.</p>
<p>So, I'm really looking forward for podcasting to move to other markets. For example, say (humor me), Tom Brokaw wants to do a report on the blight of reporters shoes. The mgmt doesn't think this is worthy to spend airtime on. So Mr. Brokaw makes a podcast and posts it, distributing the story without taking away from precious airtime.</p>
<p>But that's just my idea.</p>
