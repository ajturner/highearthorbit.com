<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2009/08/Interactive-2010-Ideas_-Page-1-1.jpg" width="77" height="98" alt="Interactive 2010 - Ideas_ Page 1-1.jpg" style="float:right; padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:5px; padding-left:5px;" /> Voting is now open for next spring's South-by-Southwest (SXSW) Interactive conference, and I was kindly asked by Josh Babetski to be on his panel <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/3415" title="SXSW 2010 PanelPicker - Time + Social + Location. What's Next In Mobile Experiences?">SXSW Panel: Time + Social + Location</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As more devices become location aware, social uses will continue to evolve beyond just who and what, to WHEN. Adding the temporal dimension creates new opportunities for social interaction. Learn about ways to leverage and use technology to add features at the intersection of temporal, social, and location.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>The panel is quite a great group - from the inceptive MapQuest that led the way in internet mapping, to the more modern social location networks of Brightkite and the recent Twitter announced location support.</p>
<p>We're now carrying the equivalent of super-computers in our pockets that have near ubiquitous connectivity, location, media capturing, and sensors. We can easily lookup businesses, cabs, and directions. But what else is next? Is it really just people checking for the closest coffee shop or hotest hookup?</p>
<p>Or do people want to ask <a href="http://www.kk.org/helpwanted/archives/001084.php" title="Kevin Kelly -- Help Wanted">"The Big Here"</a> questions: to inquire about their location and context - the history, environment, perception, and culture that surrounds them or guides them through place. Will we have tricorders, or will mobile devices be relegated to toy devices and glorified media viewers?</p>
<p>This panel includes the foremost implementers and leaders in the field that are building real tools that are used by thousands and millions of people around the world. What have we learned, and where are the next steps leading us?</p>
<p>SXSW panels work by people voting. So please <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/3415" title="SXSW 2010 PanelPicker - Time + Social + Location. What's Next In Mobile Experiences?">vote up the panel</a>. <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/vote-for-the-neocartography-panel-at-sxsw/" title="Vote for the Neocartography Panel at SXSW :: High Earth Orbit">Last year</a> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2118" title="SXSW 2010 Panel Picker - Neocartography: Mapping Design and Usability Evolved">I moderated one of the only</a> location-based panels, but fortunately this year there is a much wider aspect of geospatial discussions and presentations. So while you're at it, check out <a href="http://www.nsgic.org/blog/2009/08/gisgeospatial-at-sxsw.html" title="NSGIC News: GIS/Geospatial at SXSW?">the other good panels</a>.</p>
