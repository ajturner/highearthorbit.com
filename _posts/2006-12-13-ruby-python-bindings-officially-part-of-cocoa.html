<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html">Leopard will officially support Ruby & Python bindings in Cocoa</a> which is terrific news. I'm a big fan of interpreted languages when appropriate.</p>
<p>Of course, there are about a dozen other very cool technologies for developers in Leopard that should really make application development, faster, better, and more fun. I've gotten a chance to play some with Leopard previews, and the actual User-facing improvements are minimal. But what users will eventually get will be lots of better third-party applications. (via <a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/373" title="Theocacoa">Theocacoa</a> and <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/?p=79">Michael McCracken</a>)</p>
<p>It's great to see how much effort is going into not just creating slicker UI's, but better supporting the people that really make or break an operating environment - developers. Microsoft has had a lot of developer support for quite awhile, and I constantly hear about various .NET meetings/presentations/technologies etc. Apple really kicked it off by releasing XCode for free (no 'professional versions' need apply) and then having terrific Developer Documentation and examples. </p>
<p>The Leopard developer page makes some odd claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Mac users love to exchange quick messages, have video conferences, and collaborate on each other's desktops across the network.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>um... right, ok. I just <em>love</em> collaborating on your desktop. Anyways, I can't wait to dive in and start developing on Leopard. </p>
